Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images\n\u201cI think we are going to see a lot more of this,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is a push now and we do see both unit and dollar growth of spicy and \u2018swicy\u2019 products.\u201d\nStarbucks is just one of many coming in hot with new menu items, introducing three new Spicy Lemonade Refreshers beverages in April \u2014 which the company said was \u201cinspired by the \u2018swicy\u2019 trend, which combines sweet and spicy flavors in all sorts of creative ways.\u201d\nThe coffee chain also spiced things up with wildflower honey-infused with premium chili peppers in their Starbucks Reserve Roasteries and select stores in Chicago, New York City and Seattle, adding the Hot Honey Affogato and Hot Honey Espresso Martini to the menu.\nIn February, Coca-Cola released a \u201cspiced\u201d variation of its original recipe \u2014 a result of growing interest in spice.\n\u201cIf you go to the aisles, you\u2019ll see the amount of spiciness has gone up because consumers\u2019 taste palates have evolved. We realized that could be an opportunity for us,\u201d Coca-Cola\u2019s North America marketing chief, Shakir Moin, told the Associated Press at the time.\n3 Starbucks added the Hot Honey Affogato and Hot Honey Espresso Martini to the menu. Starbucks\nLyons Wyatt said that younger millennials, Gen Zers and Gen Alpha are the cohorts seeking out spice, and Circana found that 11% of 25-to-34-year-olds enjoy bold flavors \u2014 up 7 percentage points from 2019.\nThis is partly due to growing diversity in America and a wider range of ingredients being introduced, Jennifer Creevy, director of food and drink at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, told CNN.\n\u201cTake the rise of K-drama and K-pop, as an example. Fans of this entertainment want to consume the media but also want to taste the flavors of Korea, hence the rise of spicy Gochujang, which is now in everything from dishes to snacks, drinks and desserts,\u201d she said.\nIn addition, according to Varchasvi Singh, food service analyst with Mintel, the stereotype that American palates are \u201cbland\u201d is a misconception, and this trend proves it.\n\u201cThere certainly is an expanded appetite for spicy foods and flavors, one that is driven by wanting to explore unfamiliar ingredients and cuisines,\u201d Singh told CNN. \u201cThis enthusiasm isn\u2019t a fad, it is here to stay.\u201d\n3 Lyons Watt said that consumers can expect to see more spice in all aisles of the grocery store. On behalf of TOMBSTONE Pizza\nLyons Watt said that consumers can expect to see more spice in all aisles of the grocery store: frozen foods, drinks, ice cream, chips and so on.\n\u201cMy whole motto for a couple of years has been, \u2018The hotter the better,\u2019 because consumers gravitate to it. Traditionally it was younger consumers that were driving this, but now we\u2019ve seen bold flavors being embraced by most age groups, but the dominant are still younger consumers,\u201d she shared.",

            "content": "Scientists in California want to know if you would ever feed your cat a bowl of bug chow. They\u2019re looking to survey cat owners about their attitudes on the emerging trend of insect-based cat diets, which some researchers and advocates say could be more sustainable and possibly even healthier than traditional pet food.\nWhy Was Now the Right Time to Come Back and Do 28 Years Later? CC Share Subtitles Off\nEnglish view video Why Was Now the Right Time to Come Back and Do 28 Years?\nThe research is being conducted by scientists with the Animal Welfare Epidemiology Lab at the University of California, Davis. In the past, they\u2019ve asked pet owners about the health of their aging cats, whether they would be willing to take advantage of remote vet visits, and about how well their cats socialize with others. This latest project is being led by Emily Jang, a fourth-year undergraduate researcher and animal biology major.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOur research study mainly aims to garner cat owners\u2019 opinions on insect-based cat diets in order to assess what makes them more or less willing to purchase and use such foods,\u201d Jang told Gizmodo in an email.\nAdvertisement\nJang notes that several studies have pointed to the potential benefits of an insect-based diet for cats (and dogs). Cats in the wild will naturally eat insects occasionally, and some edible insects are known to have a rich mix of nutrients. And since most dietary allergies in cats are tied to beef, dairy, or fish, it\u2019s possible insect-based diets would be less likely to cause allergic reactions. The techniques needed to mass-produce insects for food are also thought to be more environmentally sustainable than traditional sources of meat, such as cattle.\nAdvertisement\nThere is an ongoing debate over whether edible insects can become an important part of human diets (including if enough people will ever be able to stomach the notion of eating them), but the insect-based pet food industry seems to be growing steadily. There are now dozens of brands being sold worldwide. Many of these are primarily in Europe, but the industry has begun to emerge in the U.S. as well.\nAccording to Jang, however, there\u2019s been very little research looking at what American cat owners think about all this. And that\u2019s a knowledge gap that her team is hoping to remedy.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cInsect-based cat foods have great potential for success and mass popularity, but we need to collaborate with U.S. cat owners to collect their opinions on this rising trend,\u201d Jang said.\nThe team is hoping to collect responses from at least 400 people over the age of 18 who own at least one cat. They\u2019ll be looking to see if people\u2019s attitudes toward insect cat diets could be tied to other factors, such as their concerns about the environment or their cats\u2019 existing dietary habits. They\u2019d also like to know if there\u2019s any information in particular about these diets that could convince cat owners to take a chance on them. Should the project go as scheduled, the team plans to submit their findings to a peer-reviewed journal by this September.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI hope readers will venture into this rising topic of cat foods with sincerity and consideration,\u201d Jang said.

            "content": "Business & Tech Dash N' Dine, A Tasty Take-Out Trendsetter, Opens In Brookfield \"Grab-and-Go\" is the hottest trend in food service, and a new Brookfield eatery is already pushing the category's boundaries\nThe owners of a newly opened business in Brookfield are hoping to cash in on the hottest trend in food service. ( Dash N' Dine)\nBROOKFIELD, CT \u2014 The owners of a newly opened business in Brookfield are hoping to cash in on the hottest trend in food service.\nTim Roche and his wife Danitza opened Dash N' Dine at 540 Federal Road in the Oak Meadows shopping plaza earlier this month. The new business is a combination of deli, bakery, and hot buffet offering meals by the pound. But don't worry about finding a place to sit. There are none. Dash N' Dine is take-out service only.\nCurrently, the market is open weekdays 6:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., but the couple plans on expanding hours to 7 p.m. soon. In fact, the whole idea for the business arose from the realization that dinnertime in suburbia had gotten way too out of hand. \"The kids are going to swim practice, and theater practice and dance practice. And I think everybody is in the same boat. Nobody wants to make dinner anymore,\" he said.\nThe \"grab-and-go\" food service category has been growing steadily since 2020, when the pandemic fueled consumer desire for grabbing a quick pre-made meal without sitting down in a restaurant, according to industry trade site Supermarket Perimeter. The movement is blowing up inside delicatessens as well, where the trend has been toward \"global flavors,\" according to Deli Business. Here, too, Dash N' Dine has positioned itself ahead of the curve.\n\"'Oh, there's going to be a little bitterness on this Italian bruschetta arugula fig sandwich, but it's going to be offset by the sweetness of the fig and the saltiness of the other, you know?'\" Roche said, mimicking his wife, Danitza, a graduate of the Escoffier International Culinary Institute and the star of the new eatery's show. She was the head chef for the company that makes the private label brands for Big Y and Whole Foods, Roche explained, and the trend there was clear. \"The number one thing in the food industry is grab and go,\" he said.\nDash N' Dine is not the Roches' first foray into food service. They launched a personal chef servicefor events called Mexico Gourmet a few years ago in Bethel. Tim said the process of creating a business, post-pandemic, has become much simpler.\nHe's not just talking about the legal red tape.\n\"We found this place (540 Federal Road), on Facebook marketplace, on a Saturday morning, I think he posted it,\" he said. \"And we were the only people who came in. We came in and we shook hands right there. 'We'll take it.' It was incredible.\"\nThe couple's courtship moved nearly as quickly. He met his Mexican-born wife for the first time in Germany at the Wacken Open Air Festival in 2008 (\"It's like a Woodstock for heavy metal\"), fell immediately in love, and since then, \"everything with her has been a dream come true.\" Dash N' Dine is open Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., 8:00 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays, and closed Sundays.",

            "description": "Sh\u014dgun episode 5 includes a plot surrounding a hanging pheasant, something that first seems trivial yet becomes vital to the story of Blackthorne.",
            "content": "Warning! This article contains spoilers for Sh\u014dgun episode 5.\nSummary The treatment of the pheasant in Sh\u014dgun episode 5 continues to showcase cultural differences through food trends.\nThe pheasant and its removal from Blackthorne's home causes the death of Uejiro, the gardener, through a tragic misunderstanding.\nThe hanging of pheasants is a common practice with game such as birds and other hunted creatures to mature meat.\nSh\u014dgun episode 5 includes a story in which John Blackthorne hangs a pheasant to rot, continuing a food trend of the show and proving to be vital to his character. John Blackthorne, played by Cosmo Jarvis in Sh\u014dgun's cast of characters, begins the latest installment of the show by dealing with the aftermath of Nagakado's killing of Jozen. Thanks to Nagakado's actions, it seems as though war is brewing between Toranaga, his allies, and the forces of Ishido's council by the time of Sh\u014dgun episode 5's ending.\nConcerning where Blackthorne fits into things, his training of Toranaga's men in the tactics of naval warfare may give the latter an edge against Ishido's warriors. Rather than continuing his training of the Samurai, a subplot of Sh\u014dgun episode 5 focused intently on Blackthorne's home in Japan, his relationship with Mariko, and the returning Buntaro, who was thought dead after episode 3. From reveals about Lady Mariko's family in Sh\u014dgun to a tragedy surrounding Blackthorne's gardener, these story threads coalesced thanks to the strangest of plot devices: a rotting pheasant.\nRelated What Happened To John Blackthorne\u2019s Gardener In Shogun Episode 5 The unfortunate fate of John Blackthorne's gardener in Sh\u014dgun episode 5 demonstrates how much power the Englishman wields as Toranaga's Hatamoto.\nJohn Blackthorne's Decision To Let The Pheasant Rot Explained\nA pheasant became the unlikely catalyst of Sh\u014dgun episode 5's story.\nimage via Hulu\nAt the beginning of Sh\u014dgun episode 5's story, Toranaga presents Blackthorne with a pheasant as a gift for training his warriors in British naval warfare. Upon receiving the pheasant, Blackthorne confuses those in his home by hanging the pheasant outside his house. He tells those in his service to leave it hanging, even days later, as the bird begins to rot and decay. Despite the continued bad smell, drawing of flies, and overall rotting of the pheasant\u2019s carcass, John leaves it hanging for reasons that confuse both the Japanese inhabitants of his home and Sh\u014dgun\u2019s audience.\nInterestingly, the decision to let the pheasant hang for days is one versed in historical accuracy. In the 17th century, and even to this day in some cases, game such as pheasants and other birds were often hung after being obtained. The reason for this stemmed from personal taste, with the process of hanging creatures like pheasants making the meat more ripe, thus tasting better upon being cooked. Some even preferred to allow pheasants to rot, explaining why Blackthorne did the same in Sh\u014dgun episode 5.\nSh\u014dgun Season 1 Episodes Remaining Release Date \"Chapter Six: Ladies of the Willow World\" March 26, 2024 \"Chapter Seven: A Stick of Time\" April 2, 2024 \"Chapter Eight: The Abyss of Life\" April 9, 2024 \"Chapter Nine: Crimson Sky\" April 16, 2024 \"Chapter Ten: A Dream of a Dream\" April 23, 2024\nSh\u014dgun's Pheasant Ends Up Being More Important Than Food\nThe rotting pheasant becomes part of a greater plot point in Sh\u014dgun episode 5.\nClose\nWhen first hanging the pheasant, Blackthorne insists that no one should touch the bird who works within the confines of his house. He states that the bird is forbidden, and utters three words in broken Japanese to get his point across: \"If touched - die!\" In Blackthorne's mind, this is simply an exaggeration common in the English language, uttered so that the Japanese patrons of his home know not to touch the pheasant. Blackthorne only wishes for the bird to mature to his tastes, as he wishes to prepare it well given it was a gift from Lord Toranaga.\nWhile Blackthorne did not strictly mean that someone should die if they touch the pheasant, this is what eventually transpires in Sh\u014dgun episode 5's ending.\nHowever, a central theme of Sh\u014dgun episode 5 and the show as a whole revolves around Blackthorne underestimating the dedication to honor present in 17th-century Japan. While Blackthorne did not strictly mean that someone should die if they touch the pheasant, this is what eventually transpires in Sh\u014dgun episode 5's ending. Under the orders of Muraji, the village headman and Toranaga's spy, Uejiro removed Blackthorne's pheasant. Uejiro was Blackthorne's gardener, with Fuji - Blackthorne's consort - later enforcing the apparent orders of her master by sentencing Uejiro to death for touching the bird.\nThe fate of Uejiro, strongly implied to have been orchestrated by Muraji who later frames the late Uejiro as Toranaga's spy, horrifies Blackthorne. The Englishman underestimated how dedicated the Japanese are to order and honor, believing himself to have killed Uejiro indirectly by giving what Fuji mistook for an order of death should the pheasant be removed. While the pheasant and Blackthorne's treatment of it seemed strange and somewhat humorous at first, the fate of Uejiro soon turned the ordeal - like the pheasant itself - rotten and sour.\nUejiro's body was not shown in Sh\u014dgun episode 5, potentially meaning the gardener survived due to the nature of Muraji and Toranaga's plot involving spies.\nThe Pheasant Is Another Example Of Shogun Using Food To Show Cultural Differences\nBlackthorne's pheasant highlights the differences between England and Japan in the 17th century.\nCustom Image by Sam MacLennan\nThe final way in which Sh\u014dgun episode 5's pheasant is important is that it continues the show's trend of highlighting cultural differences through food. This was first showcased in Sh\u014dgun episode 4 through natt\u014d, the meal that Mariko and Fuji were shown to eat. When Blackthorne tried the natt\u014d, the two women thought it was funny, as an Englishman might not care for the somewhat acquired taste. This trend of using food to highlight cultural differences continued with the pheasant in Sh\u014dgun episode 5, as well as the rabbit stew that Mariko, Fuji, and Buntaro refused to eat.\nNew episodes of Sh\u014dgun release every Tuesday on FX and Hulu.",

            "title": "Japan Ice Cream Market Size and Trend Analysis by 2031",
            "description": "Ice cream is a popular dessert in Japan and holds a significant presence in the country's food culture.\u00a0Japan Ice Cream Market\u00a0is estimated to grow",
            "content": "Ice cream is a popular dessert in Japan and holds a significant presence in the country\u2019s food culture. Japan Ice Cream Market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.96% for the forecast period between FY2024-FY2031 and reach USD 6.77 billion in FY2031 from USD 5.36 billion in FY2023. Factors such as changing consumer preferences, innovation in flavours and formats, and a focus on health and wellness are likely to drive the market. Additionally, increased emphasis on convenience, e-commerce, and expanding retail channels are expected to contribute to the market\u2019s expansion.\nThere has been a growing demand for premium and artisanal ice cream products in Japan. Consumers are increasingly seeking unique and high-quality flavours, textures, and ingredients. Ice cream manufacturers are focusing on creating innovative and experiential products to attract consumers. Seasonal and limited-edition ice cream products are popular in Japan, especially during festivals and specific times of the year. These products often feature flavours and designs that align with a particular season or occasion. Though, traditional yet unique flavours such as matcha (green tea), black sesame, wasabi, sakura (cherry blossom), hojicha (roasted green tea), yuzu (Japanese citrus), and azuki bean are a preferred choice of consumers, there is also a demand for international flavours such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and more adventurous options.\nRecently, in May 2023, the Japanese ice cream brand Cellato, by Omer, introduced the world\u2019s more expensive ice cream costing over USD 6400 which made it gain a title in Guinness World Records.\nDownload Free Sample Report@ https://www.marketsandata.com/industry-reports/japan-ice-cream-market/sample-request\nImpulse Ice Creams, a Highly Preferred Choice\nOn-the-go or single-serve ice creams are referred to as impulse ice creams which are widely popular in Japan as their unique packaging and bit-sized portion make them a preferred option among consumers who want to have a quick consumption of ice cream. Impulse ice creams lead the Japan ice cream market with a prominent market share followed by take-home ice cream which is forecast to register a faster growth rate owing to the increasing consumption of ice cream during winter.\nIncreasing Popularity of Vegan Ice Creams\nVeganism has been gaining popularity across the globe including Japan where more than 2% of the country\u2019s population (over 2.5 million people) are vegan. Other than veganism, lactose intolerance, shifting changes in consumer lifestyles, and environmental concerns are all factors behind the switch towards a plant-based diet which in turn is fueling the demand for non-dairy-based ice creams in Japan. Currently, there are not many options for vegan ice creams in Japan and this can act as a great opportunity for market players who are willing to expand their presence in Japan or are looking towards broadening their product portfolio.\nGarigari-Kun, a popsicle by a Japanese ice cream company Akagi Nyugyo is an icy treat that comes in a wide range of flavors such as strawberry, cola, pineapple, and pink grapefruit also suitable for vegans. Nearly 400 million of these popsicles are consumed in Japan, annually.\nUnique Packaging and Focus on Textures & Toppings\nManufacturers are continuously introducing new and innovative flavours to cater to these changing consumer preferences. Texture plays a crucial role in consumer preferences for ice cream. Japanese consumers often value a smooth, creamy, and rich mouthfeel in their ice cream. Products with unique textures, such as chewy mochi or crunchy toppings, are also well-received. To stay competitive and meet evolving consumer preferences, ice cream manufacturers in Japan constantly innovate and introduce new flavours, formats, and experiences. They closely monitor consumer trends and preferences to adapt their product offerings accordingly. For instance, Lotte Co., Ltd., a Japanese confectionery company, produced an ice cream Yukimi Daifuku which is a mochi covered vanilla ice cream. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers focus on featuring impressive, eye-catchy and innovative packaging designs, especially to attract children as their audience.\nHealth and Wellness Trends\nHealth and wellness trends have had a significant impact on the ice cream market, including in Japan, though dairy-free products have a small market in Japan. Gradually, the demand for premium and added-value products is growing in the country. Consumers are seeking healthier options in their food choices, including ice cream. This has led to a rise in demand for ice cream products that are lower in sugar, fat, and calories. To their surprise, when Shizuoka-based EECO, a Japanese producer of organic foods, rebranded their handmade organic plant-based ice cream in the middle of 2020, it quickly sold out. Manufacturers have responded by developing healthier alternatives, such as low-sugar, low-fat, and reduced-calorie ice creams. Plant-based ice creams, often made from ingredients like almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk, provide alternatives for those who avoid or are intolerant to dairy products. These options have gained traction in the market, catering to a growing segment of health-conscious and environmentally-conscious consumers. The main factor influencing this shift is health concerns.\nImpact of COVID-19 on the Japan Ice Cream Market\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a notable impact on the ice cream market in Japan, as it had on the global food and beverage industry. With the implementation of lockdowns, social distancing measures, and temporary closures of food service establishments, there was a notable decline in out-of-home consumption of ice cream. Ice cream parlours, cafes, and restaurants faced reduced foot traffic or complete closures, leading to a significant decrease in sales from these channels. Consumer concerns about safety and hygiene increased during the pandemic. Ice cream manufacturers and retailers implemented strict safety measures, such as enhanced sanitation protocols, contactless delivery options, and modified packaging to ensure consumer confidence and address health and safety concerns. The impact of COVID-19 on the ice cream market continues to evolve as the situation progresses. The industry\u2019s recovery and future growth will depend on factors such as vaccination rates, changes in consumer behaviour, and the overall economic landscape.\nJapan Ice Cream Market: Report Scope\n\u201cJapan Ice Cream Market Assessment, Opportunities, and Forecast, FY2017-FY2031F\u201d, is a comprehensive report by Markets & Data, providing in-depth analysis and assessment of the current scenario of the ice cream market in Japan, industry dynamics and opportunities, and forecasts (FY2024-FY2031).

            "title": "Ube: What does it mean when a traditional food becomes a trend?",
            "description": "Critics and trend forecasters have been hailing Ube as the \"next big thing\" for nearly a decade",
            "content": "Prior to the new year, California-based T. Hasegawa USA declared in its 2024 Food and Beverage Flavor Trends Report that ube will be the flavor of the year. The bright, purple tuberous root hailing from the Philippines has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years. But this isn\u2019t the first time the ingredient has been superficially lauded \u2014 existing merely as something punchy and not anything more than that.\nBack in 2014, Filipino cuisine as a whole was thrown around as the \"next big thing\u201d thanks to Andrew Zimmern. The \u201cBizarre Foods\u201d host claimed the trend was \u201cjust starting\u201d and would officially take off two years later in 2016.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take another year and a half to get up to critical mass, but everybody loves Chinese food, Thai food, Japanese food, and it\u2019s all been exploited. The Filipinos combined the best of all of that with Spanish technique,\u201d Zimmern told NBC\u2019s Today at the time. \u201cThe Spanish were a colonial power there for 500 years, and they left behind adobo and cooking in vinegar \u2014 techniques that, applied to those tropical Asian ingredients, are miraculous.\u201d\nIndustry trend forecasters soon began claiming the same. In 2015, National Geographic wrote, \u201cThe Filipino Food Wave Is Coming\u201d while Mashable declared that Filipino cuisine would be a \u201chuge food trend you'll devour in 2016.\u201d When the trend failed to take off as anticipated, culinary personalities and industry professionals once again attempted to push it as the hottest trend in waiting. Anthony Bourdain jumped on the bandwagon and so did restaurateur April Bloomfield, who called Filipino food the \"next big thing.\u201d\nMuch of the hype surrounding ube solely fixates on its aesthetics. Ube has a distinctive nutty, vanilla-like flavor profile, but praise is mainly awarded to its bright violet hue, which provides a pop of color in savory dishes, desserts and baked goods. That\u2019s why ube has been called the \u201cnew IT Food on Instagram\u201d and most recently, on TikTok. There\u2019s minimal focus, however, on Ube\u2019s rich history and its cultural significance. Many have failed to note that ube (which is not to be confused with purple sweet potato) comes from the yam's name in Tagalog, the national language of the Philippines.\nRarely will trend forecasters add that ube is not just a food, but also a symbol of Filipino resilience. Ube Halaya \u2014 a classic Filipino dessert made of purple yam, coconut milk, and butter \u2014 is commonly served during special occasions as an emblem of both celebration and togetherness.\nUbe is also just a sliver of Filipino cuisine, which isn\u2019t regarded as mainstream in the same way as Mexican and Chinese food. In fact, Filipino cuisine is regarded as a \u201cmonolithic cuisine,\u201d said chef and former co-host of the \u201cRacist Sandwich Podcast\u201d Soleil Ho in a 2017 Thrillist report. Simply calling it a trend doesn\u2019t do any justice to Filipino chefs or the greater Filipino community, Ho added. Food journalists and major publications aren\u2019t supporting specific Filipino chefs, their cookbooks or their upcoming projects \u2014 they\u2019re solely ogling at the cuisine. In 2017, when Scandinavian food (or New Nordic food) grew increasingly popular throughout the United States, the media\u2019s treatment of the cuisine was vastly different:\n\u201cAll of these stories about Filipino food being the next big trend \u2014 they don't tend to have lists of chefs of restaurants that translate into immediately benefiting the community,\u201d Ho told the outlet. \u201cBut when you look at these New Nordic stories, there are links to Amazon pages for cookbooks chefs have written and info on how to get reservations at a chef's next project.\u201d\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\nThat\u2019s all to say that in most cases, merely eating a specific cuisine isn\u2019t an act of respect towards the people and communities behind it. Casting a specific cuisine \u2014 or key ingredients within a cuisine \u2014 as a trend signifies that it\u2019s fleeting. One minute it\u2019s hot, the next minute it\u2019s not and pushed to the side, ultimately left to be forgotten. That\u2019s not how traditional food should be regarded.\nIn recent years, there has been much discourse about using the term \u201cethnic\u201d to describe food. The term itself means \u201ccharacteristic of or belonging to a non-Western cultural tradition,\u201d which isn\u2019t overtly racist, but has become so covertly. \u201cEthnic\u201d implies that food made by immigrants \u2014 particularly immigrants of color \u2014 is cheap and inferior. You\u2019ll rarely see French, German or Italian food be labeled as such. But take a look at Indian, Ethiopian or Filipino cuisines and the \u201cethnic\u201d label will more often than not be there.\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\n\u201cImmigrants' identities are deeply tied to the foods we bring with us,\u201d wrote Lavanya Ramanathan in her piece, titled \u201cWhy everyone should stop calling immigrant food ethnic,\u201d for The Washington Post. \u201cWhen we hear our cuisine described as exotic, hodgepodge, greasy or cheap, you might as well be remarking disdainfully about our clothes or skin color.\u201d\nCategorizing a traditional cuisine or food as both \u201cethnic\u201d and a \u201ctrend\u201d thus feels like a double-whammy. There\u2019s also the issue of who determines what constitutes a trend. Typically, it\u2019s white folks \u2014 white journalists, white foodies, white culinary experts \u2014 who are making such declarations. According to data obtained by Zippia, Inc., an online recruitment service, 67.3% of food writers are white, as of 2021. Comparatively, 12.3% of writers are Hispanic or Latino, 9.5% are Asian and 6.3% are Black. White approval and acceptance basically determines whether a food or cuisine is \u201ctrendy.\u201d They also determine whether a food or cuisine is worthy of public acclaim, which is, well, wrong.\nAs for ube, the tuberous root is becoming more widespread in Western grocery stores and restaurants. Trader Joe\u2019s notably sells a slew of ube-themed food items, including ube flavored ice cream, Ube Mochi Pancake & Waffle Mix and Ube Spread. Many online critics have complained about their lack of authentic ube flavor, saying it\u2019s non-existent in some products and downright disappointing in others: \"It's them trying to profit off of our culture without paying any tribute to us,\" wrote one user on Reddit. As for where folks can enjoy delicious, bona fide ube, many recommended checking out local Filipino bakeries, Filipino grocers and Asian stores.",

            "description": "The brand joins a grow trend of major food brands joining forces with fashion to launch new merch",
            "content": "Velveeta, the famed velvety smooth prepared cheese product, is ringing in the new year with new \u201cdrip\u201d for their fans to don.\nWhat\u2019s \u201cdrip\u201d you may ask? In the world of fashion, \u201cdrip\u201d is slang for embodying both style and swagger. An individual who has \u201cdrip\u201d is cool. They\u2019re hot. They\u2019re confident. And they\u2019re who everyone wishes they could be.\nAccording to Velveeta, no one knows \u201cdrip\u201d better than them. They are after all the creators behind the physical drip of their original cheese sauce and the \u201cunapologetic drip that embodies living \u2018La Dolce Velveeta.\u2019\u201d Velveeta\u2019s latest \u201cdrip\u201d comes in the form of a cheesy face jewelry. The brand is rolling out its 14-Karat gold Drip Lip Cuff, crafted in partnership with celebrity designer, George the Jeweler. Velveeta is inviting its fans to own the drip like never before by wearing it proudly.\n\u201cVelveeta has been best known for its cheesy goodness and melty drip that proudly graces fans\u2019 lips, and for the last several years, our goal has been to breathe new life into this legacy brand through unique and unexpected collaborations and creations,\u201d Stephanie Vance, Brand Manager for Velveeta, told Forbes. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for ways to insert ourselves into culture and trends, celebrate our fans, and give them more ways to love Velveeta \u2014 whether in food form, like the Veltini, symbolically with like Pinkies Out polish, and now fashionably with the Drip Lip Cuff.\u201d\nThe lip cuff, Vance added, strives to \u201cempower\u201d its wearers to step out with \u201can unapologetic confidence that encourages you to live life by your own rules.\u201d It also heightens the brand\u2019s founding principle of \u201cmaking outrageous pleasure a way of life.\u201d\nVelveeta\u2019s latest initiative adds to a growing trend of major food brands joining forces with fashion to launch new merchandise, boost overall sales and spur hype. The trend itself proves to grow more outlandish as it continues to persevere. Last year, Pizza Hut, in partnership with Chain \u2014 the Los Angeles based pop-up culinary collective \u2014 released its limited-edition reversible Hut Hat. The reversible bucket hats touted Pizza Hut's iconic red roof on one side and a checkered design with black, white and red on the other. A few months later, Panera introduced its chic BAGuette bag, which was essentially an elongated green purse that resembles a loaf of French bread. The bags initially sold out, then were restocked only to sell out again. They were so popular that several folks later resold them on eBay for anywhere between $200 to a whopping $3,290.\nIn the wake of Velveeta\u2019s Drip Lip Cuff, perhaps it\u2019s a bit too far-fetched to conclude that food-and-fashion partnerships have gone too far. But they\u2019re certainly breaking boundaries and challenging our thoughts on what certain brands are capable of creating. If you had asked me ten years ago about the possibility of a 14-Karat gold Drip Lip Cuff from a brand of cheese analogue, I would have laughed and surely said no.\nVelveeta\u2019s lip cuff flaunts 14-Karat gold and is priced at a whopping $77, which is significantly more expensive than Velveeta\u2019s signature cheese products. Practically speaking, would loyal consumers spend their $77 on buying a single lip cuff or 25 boxes of Velveeta\u2019s Original Big Bowl Cheese & Shells (which is available for just $3 on Amazon)? I\u2019d like to think it would be the latter.\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\nVelveeta\u2019s lip cuff, in its essence, is gimmicky. But gimmicky products, as we\u2019ve seen, have actually been quite clever. Such food-fashion products are rarely revered for their practicality but rather, their impracticality. Food fashion isn\u2019t meant to be functional, it\u2019s mainly meant to be shocking. There\u2019s something incredibly alluring about rocking a limited-edition piece of jewelry or clothing and flaunting it on social media in exchange for several likes, clicks or views. It\u2019s attention-grabbing. It\u2019s enticing. And it encourages others to spend their money on the product in question.\nTake for example fast food\u2019s partnerships with high fashion in the past. Frito-Lay collaborated with international fashion house Balenciaga to debut a $1,500 clutch that resembles a crumpled, discarded bag of Lay's potato chips. There\u2019s also Jeremy Scott's McDonald's-inspired Moschino collection, complete with Golden Arches-decked handbags on plastic food trays. And there\u2019s Charlotte Olympia's and Kate Spade's Chinese takeout box-inspired purses. None of these products are financially feasible, nor are they a necessity. Instead, they are made to elicit awe. In the same vein as fast food and cheap eats, such products provide us with instant gratification and a quick hit of pleasure.\nIn the age of social media, major food brands are finding new ways to boost hype in an effort to garner more consumers. It\u2019s hard to say what Velveeta \u2014 or any other food brand \u2014 will come up with next. Whatever it is, it will certainly be anything but boring.",

            "description": "New York Post worked on our ins and outs list for 2024 \u2014 forecasting and trend-analyzing what'll be \"in\" and what'll be \"out this upcoming year \u2014 from beauty to food.",
            "content": "New York Post may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you buy through our links.\nHere at the New York Post, we\u2019re all about the trends. From the latest buzzy skincare item (like eye creams) to new ways of cooking (with olive oil in tow, of course), there isn\u2019t a product or service that *doesn\u2019t* fascinate us.\nAlas, we\u2019ve landed at the TikTok-viral \u201cins\u201d and \u201couts\u201d list. Here, many creators are posting a curated grouping of trends, themes and products that may be in style for 2024 (perhaps, lip balms) and others that may be out of style for the coming year (possibly, Crocs, though that one can conjure some controversy).\nBecause we\u2019re constantly reporting on products, services and trends \u2014 teaming up with some experts on most shopping guides \u2014 we decided to craft our own \u201cins\u201d and \u201couts\u201d list of 2024. After all, it\u2019s only natural when our 9-to-5 consists of majorly tracking all things retail, brands and new launches. (Related: 100 Trending Gift Ideas, per Google Shopping).\nAhead, each item is part of our \u201cins\u201d list, while we also hint at some habits and items that might be going \u201cout\u201d for each one. After years in the biz, we\u2019re pretty confident about our trends forecast, FYI.\nWholesome eating instead of restricting\nBlue Apron\nFirst things first \u2014 it\u2019s important to recognize that everyone\u2019s diet and lifestyle is different, so always consult with a dietitian or nutritionist for advice on what may work best for you. However, it\u2019s safe to say nobody is privy to restrictive diets (you know, the \u201cit\u2019s Jan. 1, so I\u2019m going to live off of kale and only eat X amount of portions\u201d type of living).\nFor that reason, the New York Post predicts \u2014 more or less, knows \u2014 that wholesome eating is a surefire \u201cin\u201d for 2024. Focusing on a balanced diet in mind, there are a variety of meal kits to look into (not to mention, we tested 20+ of them for years). Blue Apron happens to be one of our favorites for customized recipes and a rotisserie of options.\nEye creams, eye creams and more eye creams\nAmazon\nIf we may say so ourselves, eye cream is an underrated step in the skincare process. From our experience speaking with board-certified dermatologists, they likely consider eye cream to be an optional step in between your favorite cleanser and moisturizer \u2014 though they\u2019ll typically mention how eye cream can be the cherry on top of your skincare sundae.\nWhat\u2019s out? The seven-step skincare routine. Sometimes, the less-is-more-mentality is more beneficial for your skin.\nWe recently tested 50+ eye creams and the Sunday Riley Auto Correct Brightening and De-Puffing Eye Contour Cream is our favorite of them all. Not only does a quality eye cream make you feel luxurious but this one in particular truly glistened on the skin (and, made us not even want to apply makeup).\nTaking time to focus on mindfulness\nHeadspace\nWith so many stressors that seemed to put everyone on edge in 2023, we\u2019re confident that taking a few moments each day to breathe and be mindful \u2014 even for only five or 10 minutes \u2014 is what\u2019ll surely be \u201cin.\u201d What\u2019s out? Worrying, over-analyzing and not putting yourself first.\nWe\u2019ve been using Headspace for years and truly can\u2019t start our days without it. From pre-packaged plans to guided meditations, you\u2019ll quickly find it serving you well as a centralized hub to calm your concerns.\nHair bow clips as a fashion statement\nAmazon\nDon\u2019t come after us \u2014 the hair bows trend is going to go out of style in 2024, and not because we don\u2019t love it. It\u2019s quite overused, somewhat impractical and a bit too saturated online right now.\nBut, that doesn\u2019t mean all hair bows will be \u201cout\u201d this year. We anticipate the rise of the hair bow claw clip. Consider it a marriage of the oh-so-popular claw clip and the more recently trending hair bow. Plus, they\u2019re adorable, chic and affordable.\nMuted pink colors over hot pink tones\nAnthropologie\nAs an aside from the \u201cBarbiecore\u201d days of 2023, the New York Post doesn\u2019t deem pink out of style. While the over-worn Barbie pink may be tossed to the side, muted pinks and peach tones \u2014 even fuschia and magenta tones instead \u2014 will certainly be \u201cin\u201d for 2024.\nOne of our favorite destinations for sweaters and cardigans is Anthropologie (seriously, you should see our closets). The Mariel Longline Cardigan Sweater is effortlessly sophisticated whether worn to work or to a weekend brunch and we love its well-made quality.\nLearning instead of scrolling\nMasterClass\nAnother \u201cout\u201d for 2024: meaningless scrolling. This holds especially true if you have an overt distaste for the weekly rise in your screen time.\nThe solution? Making time for intentional, fun learning. MasterClass is one of our favorite platforms for this (read our review of the platform for more), especially because we\u2019ve gained insight from seasoned experts like Bobbi Brown, Gordon Ramsay, Martha Stewart and more household names.\nScrapbooking\nMichaels\nWe\u2019ve been seeing *plenty* of people creating physical vision boards for 2024 \u2014 and we don\u2019t see the craftiness craze going anywhere. What\u2019s out? Not making time to flex the more inquisitive, left-side of your brain.\nScrapbooking \u2014 and, the act of going to a craft store like Michaels \u2014 is what we anticipate being \u201cin\u201d for 2024. Not only will you find a variety of ribbons, page accents and stickers (like glittery flower appliqu\u00e9s and gold swirl borders) but the art of scrapbooking itself is a tangible momento to look back on and see how incredible the year has been for you.\nNot to mention, this 12\u00d712 scrapbook is one of our personal favorites, thanks to its spiral-bound design. We look forward to planning our pages, printing our photos (with the new Canon Ivy 2 Mini Photo Printer we were recently gifted this past holiday season) and enjoying this new form of unwinding in the evening time and on the weekends.\nLip masks over lip balm\nSephora\nWhile we\u2019re not 100% firm that lip balms will be \u201cout\u201d in 2024, we\u2019re 100% certain that lip masks will take full reign this year. One of our favorites that we\u2019ve been using religiously is the Farmacy Apple Lip Smoothie Vitamin C + Peptide Lip Balm. It locks in moisture to your lip area at large and has a delicious fruity flavor and a glossy appeal.\nFor a lip mask that\u2019s equally as hydrating but applies clear, we recommend the belif Aqua Bomb Overnight Lip Mask ($22). Its tub and quick-fix formulation makes us use it on repeat as well.\nCheck out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A new study adds to evidence that severe obesity is becoming more common in young U.S. children.\nThere was some hope that children in a government food program might be bucking a trend in obesity rates \u2014 earlier research found rates were dropping a little about a decade ago for those kids. But an update released Monday in the journal Pediatrics shows the rate bounced back up a bit by 2020.\nThe increase echoes other national data, which suggests around 2.5% of all preschool-aged children were severely obese during the same period.\n\u201cWe were doing well and now we see this upward trend,\u201d said one of the study\u2019s authors, Heidi Blanck of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cWe are dismayed at seeing these findings.\u201d\nThe study looked at children ages 2 to 4 enrolled in the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides healthy foods and other services to preschool-aged children in low-income families. The children were weighed and measured.\nThe researchers found that 2.1% of kids in the program were severely obese in 2010. Six years later, the rate had dipped to 1.8%. But by 2020, it was 2%. That translates to about 33,000 of more than 1.6 million kids in the WIC program.\nSignificant increases were seen in 20 states with the highest rate in California at 2.8%. There also were notable rises in some racial and ethnic groups. The highest rate, about 2.8%, was in Hispanic kids.\nExperts say severe obesity at a very early age is nearly irreversible, and is strongly associated with chronic health problems and an early death.\nIt\u2019s not clear why the increase occurred, Blanck said.\nWhen WIC obesity rates dropped, some experts attributed it to 2009 policy changes that eliminated juice from infant food packages, provided less saturated fat, and tried to make it easier to buy fruits and vegetables.\nThe package hasn\u2019t changed. But \u201cthe daily hardships that families living in poverty are facing may be harder today than they were 10 years ago, and the slight increases in the WIC package just weren\u2019t enough,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a Duke University childhood obesity researcher.\nThe researchers faced challenges. The number of kids in WIC declined in the past decade. And the study period included 2020, the year the COVID-19 pandemic hit, when fewer parents brought their children in to see doctors. That reduced the amount of complete information available.\nDespite it\u2019s limitations, it was a \u201cvery well done study,\u201d said Deanna Hoelscher, a childhood obesity researcher at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health, \u201cIt gives you a hint of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s happened since 2020 is not yet known. Some small studies have suggested a marked increase in childhood obesity \u2014 especially during the pandemic, when kids were kept home from schools, eating and bedtime routines were disrupted and physical activity decreased.\n\u201cWe are thinking it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Hoelscher said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

REUTERS/Daniel Acker/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\nOct 25 (Reuters) - Millions more Americans had difficulty securing enough food in 2022 compared to the year prior, including 1 million households with children, interrupting a years-long trend of declining hunger in the U.S., according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture released on Monday.\nWhile the USDA did not provide an explanation for the rise, previous reports from food banks and the U.S. Census Bureau have indicated that hunger is up in the U.S. as low-income Americans struggle to recover from the pandemic and from the end of expanded food assistance.\nThe USDA report found that 12.8% of households, or 17 million households, struggled to get enough food in 2022, up from 10.2%, or 13.5 million households, in 2021.\nNearly 7 million of those households faced very low food security, meaning members' normal eating patterns were disrupted or food intake dropped because of limited resources, USDA said.\nFood insecurity had fallen steadily between 2011 and 2021 before spiking in 2022, the report showed.\nRegular surveys by the Census Bureau since the start of the pandemic have also showed rising hunger. More than 27.6 million Americans reported experiencing food scarcity in the most recent survey, conducted between Sept. 20 and Oct. 2, up 9.5% from the start of the year.\nHunger could be exacerbated further if the government shutdown narrowly avoided in September comes to pass in November, anti-hunger groups warn.\nThe USDA said in September that the Women, Infants, and Children program, for instance, would stop distributing benefits to its 7 million participants within days of a shutdown.\n\"WIC is one of our best lines of defense against nutrition insecurity, and Congress must ensure it remains available for anyone who needs it,\" said Nell Menefee-Libbey, public policy manager at the National WIC Association.\nReporting by Leah Douglas; editing by Jonathan Oatis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "title": "Here\u2019s how a fashion brand for \u201cOld Jewish Men\u201d celebrates modern deli culture",
            "description": "Salon sat down with the brand's co-partner Bryan Seversky, who spoke more about the food and fashion trend",
            "content": "What do Pete Davidson, Bella Hadid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Travis Scott all have in common, aside from their A-list status? They\u2019ve recently embraced a unique kind of street style \u2014 one that\u2019s emblazoned with logos of famous delicatessens and their most popular offerings, like knishes, pastrami, pickles and bagels.\nAptly dubbed \u201cdelicore,\u201d the latest food-fashion fad celebrates one of New York City\u2019s most prized staples: the local deli. Last September, delis officially earned their \u201cIt\u201d status within the high fashion world when whimsical clothing designer Batsheva Hay debuted her Spring 2023 collection at the famed Ben\u2019s Kosher Deli amid New York Fashion Week. However, prior to then, delis enjoyed their fair share of up-and-coming collaborations. In 2020, Gyllenhaal partnered with Russ & Daughters on a tie-dye salmon-hued T-shirt benefiting the Independent Restaurant Coalition. In 2021, the Hollywood star and deli joined forces again to release a $150 black \u201cLOX\u201d hoodie benefitting the Actors Fund. And in the following year, Coach and gourmet emporium Zabar\u2019s collaborated to put out limited-edition swag, including a $495 sweater and a $550 leather tote.\nOutside of high fashion, several delis \u2014 both old and new \u2014 began selling their own merchandise in the wake of pandemic shutdowns. Desperate for new revenue streams, restaurants and shops turned to retail, wrote Maggie Hennessy for Bon App\u00e9tit. Their efforts were ultimately successful and even captured the attention of countless celebrities. Take for example Davidson, Scott and former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz, who have all sported Uncle Paulie\u2019s hats from Uncle Paulie\u2019s Deli.\nSure, delicore may have the word \u201cdeli\u201d in its name, but it\u2019s not exclusively being claimed by delis. The tasty trend is also a prominent aesthetic in Old Jewish Men (OJM), a popular social-media-account-turned-fashion-brand. OJM first began on Instagram about five-and-a-half years ago when founder Noah Rinsky was visiting his parents who retired in northern Israel. Amid the pandemic, Rinsky and his co-partner Bryan Seversky expanded OJM into a clothing company that specializes in comfort wear, like T-shirts, hats and sweaters. Think of the kinds of clothes commonly seen in Adam Sandler and Larry David\u2019s wardrobe.\nThe crux of OJM is right in its name \u2014 old Jewish men. And because delis have roots in Jewish culture, history and cuisine, it only made sense for OJM to adopt the trend into its clothes.\n\u201c[For] old Jewish men, one of their natural gathering points is the deli,\u201d explained Seversky. \u201cSo it makes sense for us as a brand to kind of celebrate that culture\u2026It's celebrating this golden era that in the future, won't exist since these old guys are keeping it alive.\u201d\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\nA few deli-themed OJM apparel include its Pickle Princess Crop Tank, a green-hued tank adorned with silver gems; and its Brain on Drugs shirt, a simple white tee with an image of a plain and severely burnt bagel. OJM also has a Mets-style \u201cMeats\u201d jersey, which was inspired by a bizarre, meat-fueled dream:\n\u201cMy friend Will had this sweaty, meat-induced fever dream one night where he had this idea of combining the Mets with a meat design. When I heard this, I was like, \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s definitely something here!\u201d Seversky said. \u201cI went to work and started to design [the collection]. And I realized that there\u2019s such a strong connection between the Mets, which is the unofficial old Jewish man\u2019s baseball team in New York, and deli culture, which is also huge with old Jewish men.\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\nHe continued, \u201cIt just felt like this perfect mish-mash, this perfect coming together of two different things into one. It started off with simple T-shirts and hats and then, we created a jersey.\u201d\nAs for Seversky\u2019s thoughts on why OJM\u2019s deli-themed apparel have been a major hit amongst consumers, he said that delicore, as a whole, celebrates a persevering, widely-loved industry. Such clothing invokes the same feelings of pride and loyalty as a sports jersey or a band tee.\n\u201cWhen you have a piece of clothing that is the branding of the deli, it\u2019s almost like wearing a sports jersey or a band shirt,\u201d Seversky said. \u201cYou're showing allegiance to something. I think what people are drawn to about the deli is that it\u2019s a spot for the everyday man. And it\u2019s about persevering this older, more traditional, less in-your-face aesthetic that\u2019s a bit more blue collar.\u201d\nSimply put, delicore reminds us why the deli continues to be a go-to spot for many today. Delis are steeped in tradition and tap into our desire for comfort and nostalgia. That being said, a casual clothing brand coupled with good deli eats just makes sense. Yeah, delicore is \"not, like, Balenciaga,\" as Davidson famously said. It's far better than that.",

            "content": "\u201cGirl dinner\u201d is the latest food trend, with the hashtag #girldinner gaining a whopping 1.3 billion views on TikTok.\nWomen everywhere are showing off what they pulled together from their fridges and pantries to have as a low-effort dinner.\nMaybe you put a plate together of some leftover slices of deli meat, fruits and cheese and crackers rather than making a full-out meal.\nIt takes just a few minutes and you use practically no energy: That is a girl dinner.\nSelf-proclaimed \u201cgirl dinner\u201d creator Olivia Maher claimed in a May TikTok that \u201cin medieval times peasants had to eat nothing but bread and cheese,\u201d arguing that the scraps are actually what she would consider her \u201cideal meal.\u201d\nMany have branded the trend \u201cdisturbing\u201d \u2014 but there might be more nutritional value to this snacklike dinner than one might think.\nA sort of charcuterie board for one, the \u201cgirl dinner\u201d can be a healthy option if there\u2019s enough variety.\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re centering your plate around a protein source and including healthy fats and fibers, then you can add other fun stuff to your plate,\u201d Olivia Amitrano said. Getty Images\nWebMD medical team member Dr. Neha Pathak told The Post that \u201ca \u2018girl dinner\u2019 gives you the chance to take back the joy, focus on you and be mindful of what your body needs without having to worry about anyone else.\n\u201cWhenever I prescribe healthy-balanced meals made up mostly of fruits and veggies, I know that for a lot of people that\u2019s overwhelming and too much work. \u201c\nPathak \u2014 who is dual board-certified in internal medicine and lifestyle medicine \u2014 stressed the importance of making sure your plate has filling and healthy portion sizes, with enough protein, vegetables and carbohydrates.\n\u201cYou just want to be sure you\u2019re making the meal about a healthy, joyful you, and not making the meal all about disease-causing, unhealthy processed foods,\u201d Pathak shared. \u201cPretty is the point \u2026 you want your plate to be colorful and beautiful.\n\u201cAs a married, lifestyle medicine physician mom with three daughters, there\u2019s actually nothing I look forward to more than a night that\u2019s just a \u2018girl dinner,'\u201d Pathak said, adding that she\u2019s all for taking the extra step of adding \u201cgirl lunches\u201d and \u201cgirl breakfasts\u201d to the mix.\nOlivia Amitrano, the \u201cOG wellness influencer,\u201d told The Post that the \u201cgirl dinner\u201d trend can actually be \u201cone of the most balanced ways\u201d to prepare a meal for the gut microbiome \u2014 which is integral to digestion and generating nutrients \u2014 and to enrich gut diversity.\nAmitrano, founder of wellness brand Organic Olivia, shared that gut diversity is not about the number of good \u201cbugs\u201d within our gut microbiome, but rather the richness and diversity of the bacteria.\n\u201cGirl dinner\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be all healthy foods \u2014 there\u2019s still room for treats. Getty Images\nSo rather than dosing our bodies with probiotics, achieving gut diversity should be done through eating fiber and greens from diverse sources.\nIn fact, a 2019 report from the environmental watchdog World Wildlife Fund found that 75% of the food we consume comes from just 12 plant sources and five animal sources\n\u201cWe\u2019re grabbing the same food staples from the grocery stores over and over again and we get stuck in these ruts of meals that we hyper-fixate on, and we eat the same thing every day because it\u2019s easy or we have it prepped or we have the same Sweetgreen order,\u201d Amitrano explained, noting the importance of expanding one\u2019s palate to a range of plants and fibers.\nGirls everywhere are showing off what they pulled together from their fridges and pantries for a low-effort dinner. Getty Images/iStockphoto\nAmitrano said that her \u201cperfect girl dinner\u201d would be protein-forward, centering on cottage cheese as a dip/sauce/base for a hefty serving of protein, adding some cut-up veggies for color on the plate, as well as a source of carbs such as a piece of toast with hummus or avocado to get healthy fat in the mix.\n\u201cI\u2019m putting together all these little leftover fun things that are in my fridge, and I actually end up making a far more diverse meal than I would have if I just had my usual chicken salad that I make every single night of the week,\u201d she said.\nShe believes having a \u201cgirl dinner\u201d presents an opportunity to try unusual, fibrous plants and foods that one wouldn\u2019t normally consider as a side dish \u2014 pickles and other fermented items, for example.\nAmitrano also observed that meals leading to higher levels of gut diversity could have health benefits for women with polycystic ovary syndrome or patients with Type 2 diabetes.\n\u201cYou want to get as many different plants and odd foods into your diet per week as possible, and \u2018girl dinner\u2019 is a great way to do that,\u201d Amitrano said.\nRather than dosing our bodies with probiotics, achieving gut diversity can be done through eating diverse sources of fiber and plants. Getty Images/iStockphoto\nBut \u201cgirl dinner\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be all healthy foods \u2014 there\u2019s still room for treats.\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re centering your plate around a protein source and including healthy fats and fibers, then you can add other fun stuff to your plate, like chips or pretzels or a glass of wine, whatever else you want to put in there that\u2019s fun, as long as you have the base of protein and fiber first,\u201d Amitrano added.\nHowever, the trend arrives amid criticism that TikTok promotes \u201ctoxic\u201d diet culture and \u201cglorifies\u201d excessive weight loss, and alongside an alarming rise in adolescent eating disorders since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmitrano noted that unhealthy \u201cgirl dinners\u201d can happen because people are too exhausted to put together a nourishing meal.\n\u201cSometimes \u2018girl dinners\u2019 on TikTok can look a little sad \u2014 it\u2019s just too little food,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that there is a risk there that we might not be meeting our caloric needs. Just eating enough is so important when you\u2019re having \u2018girl dinner.\u2019\n\u201cYou want to make sure you\u2019re looking at it as an opportunity for abundance and having fun with what\u2019s left on your fridge and putting a lot on your plate and seeing what you gravitate towards, and not limiting yourself or judging yourself,\u201d Amitrano continued. \u201cDon\u2019t look at it as a diet trend or a way to eat less, but look at it as a way to have more fun with your food and not pigeonhole yourself into that same meal rut that we get stuck in.\u201d\nWhether or not one should be worried by the increase of the trend is a concern of context and pattern.\nEating disorders specialist Chase Bannister told The Post that it\u2019s unreasonable to regard one single meal as a cause for alarm.\nThe trend comes amid lots of criticism that TikTok promotes \u201ctoxic\u201d diet culture and \u201cglorifies\u201d weight loss, as well as the alarming rise of adolescent eating disorders since the COVID-19 pandemic. Getty Images\nHowever, if an eating habit arises incapable of meeting nutritional needs, \u201cthat\u2019s a red flag moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no crime to have fun with food. That said, this trend raises some important questions, both clinically and culturally,\u201d Bannister said.\nOne big concern to Bannister is what could happen when people \u201coverlook the thinly-veiled misogyny of these words,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat makes food \u2018girl food\u2019? And, perhaps bluntly, when surveying the landscape of images, why are there so many salads and so few cheeseburgers? I do wonder what the perfectly-sized, perfectly-presented \u2018girl\u2019 of the \u2018girl dinner\u2019 is supposed to look like. And what are the slow, creeping costs of the performative social media enterprise upon bodies and minds?\u201d he questioned.\nBannister continued, \u201cAs a clinician, these questions concern me greatly, but these questions escape the bounds of the therapy session. As people, we need to call attention to potentially risky behaviors, to the commercialization of bodies, and to the problem of conflating our encounters with food, body, weight, size, and appearance with our human value.\n\u201cWe owe ourselves \u2014 and each other \u2014 better than that.\u201d\nBut Bannister, founder of the Veritas Collaborative system of eating disorders treatment centers, added that it\u2019s absolutely possible to have these non-traditional meals without engaging in disordered eating.\n\u201cWe find ways to nourish our bodies while leading busy lives, traveling or in myriad social situations, and few of us have endlessly stocked pantries to craft a perfectly balanced meal every moment our body needs energy or gives us hunger cues,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting creative with the foods we have available to us is part of being human.\u201d",

            "content": "Let food be thy medicine.\nHeard the one about breakfast being the most important meal of the day? Don\u2019t forget to feed your skin as well, according to the so-called beauty experts of TikTok.\nSelf-care influencers on the popular social media app are suddenly touting something called the \u201cskincare breakfast,\u201d a morning feeding routine said to guarantee a perfect complexion.\nAlice Sun is just one content creator eagerly sharing skin-friendly supping tips with her followers, from glowing skin mocktails to moisturizing tofu salads and a range of healing broths.\nSun recently bragged to her audience, numbering more than 340,000, that she had perfected the skincare breakfast \u2014 a menu of salmon, kimchi, rice, miso broth and cucumbers.\nThe Chinese medicinal healing enthusiast, who recently moved from New York to Los Angeles, claimed the \u201cgut-friendly,\u201d \u201chydrating\u201d meal has \u201cmade a huge difference\u201d for her dry, sensitive skin.\nThe latest TikTok trend is edible skincare \u2014 otherwise known as, well, food. Getty Images/iStockphoto\nIsabelle Lux, who boasts more than 514,000 followers, outlined her \u201cglowing skin breakfast,\u201d comprised of coconut-based yogurt, pumpkin and chia seeds, berries and probiotics.\nAnd another creator, Millie Mae, swears by her daily morning oatmeal bowls to keep her skin blemish-free.\nBut Dr. Kellyann Petrucci, a nutrition expert and best-selling author, said food is \u201cnot the only factor\u201d to healthier skin.\n\u201cThere is a link between the health of your gut, especially your microbiome, and the health of your skin. So if you\u2019re struggling with pesky skin-related issues that aren\u2019t responding to topical solutions, looking inward is always a good idea. And healing your gut is the first step,\u201d she told The Post, adding that bone broth, collagen powder and a source of fiber are her \u201cfavorite foods\u201d for healing the gut.\nPetrucci warns the acne-prone to avoid \u201csugary, high-carb foods,\u201d as they\u2019re a culprit of a blood sugar spike.\n\u201cSugar, in turn, ramps up your production of AGEs, which stands for advanced glycation end products. These \u2018stiffen\u2019 collagen and elastin, damaging your skin and making it harder to repair,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe result: You look years older than you are.\u201d\nBut as delicious as it all may sound, these skin hacks aren\u2019t necessarily backed by fact, experts say.\n\u201cThere is no evidence in the science to support the use of any specific food to benefit skin,\u201d board-certified dermatologist Dr. Natalia Spierings told Metro.\nForget the serums, oils and creams \u2013 online, creators are boasting particular foods as the key to a clear complexion. Getty Images\nWhile eating too much processed junk could negatively impact complexion, Spierings said there is no cure-all food for skin.\n\u201cBut there is no specific food or thing someone can do to improve their skin \u2018from within\u2019 \u2013 aside from stop smoking if you smoke,\u201d Spierings said.\nThe skincare breakfast idea appears to have been spawned by another recent ingestible skincare trend on TikTok, which had influencers swearing that a once-daily vitamin could ban blemishes.\n\u201cBut there is no specific food or thing someone can do to improve their skin \u2018from within\u2019 \u2013 aside from stop smoking if you smoke,\u201d she said.

It shows our identity.\u201d\nWith its bright red sign, C as in Charlie joined a herd of restaurants that have embraced a certain aesthetic: dim interiors lit primarily in red. In April, the New York magazine columnist Tammie Teclemariam wrote that C as in Charlie\u2019s lighting makes \u201cit feel as much like a darkroom as a proper eating establishment.\u201d\nSome, like Baru, in Cincinnati, and Rouge Room, a Paris-inspired lounge in Las Vegas, embrace darkroom-core as a way to signal a transition to a nocturnal atmosphere.

            "content": "For the weekend before her 30th birthday, Mirina Landry was \u201ccraving some kind of new experience,\u201d but didn\u2019t have time to travel far. So she and her partner drove the hour from Topeka to Overland Park, Kansas, to try Korean corn dogs, the batter-dipped meat or cheese on a stick, often dusted with sugar, ramen noodles, puffed rice or an increasing arms race of toppings and sauces.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a lot of stuff on social media with the hot dogs and the mozzarella, but also with different flavors like Hot Cheetos and stuff like that. It all looks so good,\u201d Landry, who described herself as \u201cwhite as white can be,\u201d said after her visit to K-Street Hotdog, where she opted for one made of mozzarella cheese and encrusted with fried potato cubes.\nKorean corn dogs were one of the biggest food trends in 2021. That summer, newly vaxxed and guided by TikTok and Instagram, people waited in lines an hour deep at outposts like Two Hands or Oh K-Dog NYC in New York. Buoyed by the growing popularity of Korean culture \u2014 K-pop, K-dramas, K-beauty and K-food \u2014 nicknamed the Korean wave or \u201cHallyu,\u201d the photogenically crispy, gooey, portable snack rode a wave of popularity with influencers and trend-chasing diners.\nBut even as the hype subsided in diverse coastal hot spots like New York and Los Angeles, the Korean corn dog has maintained \u2014 and even increased \u2014 its following as franchises like Two Hands and Ssong\u2019s Hotdog expand their footprint into the American heartland. Hundreds are scheduled to open in Arkansas, Kansas, Texas and Missouri, in cities not known to be hubs of Asian food, a testament to the enduring popularity of Korean food and to its adoption into an expanding American palate.\nMirina Landry at K-Street Hotdog in Overland Park, Kan. Courtesy of Mirina Landry\nFrom a postwar processed treat to food trend\nUnlike American corn dogs, Korean corn dogs (called hot dogs in Korea) use a wheat or mochi (rice flour) batter in place of cornmeal, resulting in a chewier texture. They\u2019re made of a meat hot dog or a mozzarella stick or half of each, or fish cake, which was the original Korean version, a culmination of both the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century and the longstanding presence of U.S. troops after World War II.\nProcessed meats such as wieners, sausages and hams were known to Koreans in postwar South Korea due to the U.S. military presence. Jooyeon Rhee, Penn State Institute for Korean Studies\n\u201cProcessed meats such as wieners, sausages and hams were known to Koreans in postwar South Korea due to the U.S. military presence, but they were used mainly as ingredients for army stew (budae jjigae). What Koreans call \u2018hot dogs\u2019 are really corn dogs that became a popular street food from the mid-1970s,\u201d said Jooyeon Rhee, an associate professor and the director of the Penn State Institute for Korean Studies.\nIn the 1970s, South Korea was a low-income country under a military dictatorship, and meat such as pork or beef was hard to come by. So, the original corn dogs were a mixture of flour and fish, a derivative of the Japanese fishcake \u201ckamaboko.\u201d\n\u201cThe wieners, more than the fried dough, were the main reason for the popularity of the Korean corn dogs among schoolchildren. Imagine how school kids became utterly disappointed when the wieners inside their corn dogs were much smaller than usual on some days. Or worse, there were no wieners at all, which happened from time to time: You could not tell whether there was one unless you digged deep enough to see the stick,\u201d Rhee said, speaking from personal experience.\n\u201cCorn dogs were a thing of the past when Koreans had not yet been exposed to Western foods, but they were revived through nostalgia marketing about a decade ago. A number of corn dog franchises emerged, and major food companies now produce and export packaged corn dogs to many countries,\u201d she added.\n\u2018We literally don\u2019t have any Korean customers\u2019: How K-dog popularity grew across the U.S.\nFood industry veterans say that even with the swiftness of social media phenomena, trends can take a while longer to travel nationally but can have a longer shelf life.\n\u201cKansas is a little different, trends are a lot slower. Stuff like that took off in bigger cities a lot earlier, even the yogurt ice creams [Korean chains like Red Mango] took off in big states, died off and then came to smaller states,\u201d said David Ahn, 43, one of the officers of the company that owns K-Street Hotdog.\nA lot of younger people are interested in stuff like this. A lot of Latinas, Caucasians and African American people, too. Mostly because of K-pop. David Ahn\nAhn\u2019s family business already owned a Korean grocery store, bakery and three Korean fried chicken restaurants in the Kansas City area, when they considered adding to their Korean culinary offerings. In 2021, they opened a Ssong\u2019s franchise, which was initially very successful and then plateaued. After severing ties with the chain, the Ahns rebranded as K-Street Hotdog earlier this year, using their own recipes and building out the menu with side items like the popular tornado fries and hotteok, a dessert pancake with a caramelized cinnamon and sesame filling.\n\u201cA lot of the bigger cities rely more on Korean customers, and there\u2019s only so many Korean people. We target Caucasians and African Americans. Because we literally don\u2019t have any Korean customers ... maybe 5%, if that,\u201d Ahn, who emigrated from South Korea when he was 12, said. \u201cA lot of younger people are interested in stuff like this. A lot of Latinas, Caucasians and African American people, too. Mostly because of K-pop.\u201d\nRobin Rhee, president of the Asian food distributor Rhee Bros, has been watching Korean food grow in popularity for the past two decades, and notes that food trends for ethnic food in America can take circuitous paths.\n\u201cWe see a lot of growth in Korean hot dogs and Korean food in general and snacks, in between Sioux City and Kansas City. It\u2019s the college towns. Asian immigrants are moving to middle America for jobs \u2014 Chinese, Cambodian, Hmong. Korean food is not just popular with white Americans but other Asian ethnicities because they\u2019re listening to Korean music, watching dramas. The colleges where Asian Americans are going now are not just UCLA or NYU \u2014 the same goes for Asian international students, and they\u2019re driving their friends to it as well,\u201d he said.\nAbout three years ago, distributors started importing Korean corn dogs to the U.S. at about the same time the franchises started opening. The trend speaks to \u201cthe increasing popularity of Korean food,\u201d he added.\nLast Saturday, Kristy Fitzpatrick, 30, and two of her friends from St. Louis were in Kansas City for a Taylor Swift concert and stopped at K-Street Hotdog. She and one of the friends had tried Korean corn dogs in Phoenix at a local H-Mart, and that had piqued the interest of the other friend.\n\u201cThey were great, we all loved them \u2014 just stinks that there aren\u2019t any shops like that in St. Louis,\u201d she said.\nFor now.",

There doesn\u2019t have to be a whole chicken or juicy steak meatspreading center stage; there doesn\u2019t have to be pasta or potato padding. Girl dinner can be eaten on the couch while binge-watching \u201cThe Bear\u201d or reading a novel or staring into space. Yet it is not compatible with another TikTok term of the moment, \u201c bed rotting \u201d (116 million-plus views), the trend formerly known as depression. Bed-rotting dinner is Doritos from the bag, ice cream from the carton, if it happens at all. It is not cute snacks assembled cutely on a cute plate, a dinner that makes a woman feel self-cared for, nourished, and a touch transgressive. (Girl dinner is also not, as some have said, eating disordered. Gauging and satisfying one\u2019s own appetite is the opposite of that.) Girl dinner is the culinary equivalent of Rep.

Enter Email Sign Up\nI have eaten many girl dinners in my life, and some bed-rotting ones too. But what I\u2019m eating these days takes a few steps deeper into the enchanted realm of IDGAF. Let\u2019s call it Cucumbers With Stuff. It could also, theoretically, be called \u201chot girl dinner\u201d \u2014 but, like, literally hot. It is not likely to spark a TikTok trend.\nAdvertisement\nIt started because I impulsively purchased a wedge of Cambozola, the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt of cheese, merging the best attributes of precursors Camembert and Gorgonzola. Then I got home and thought, great, now I\u2019m going to eat the entire thing myself. I solved the problem by making Cambozola dressing, crumbling it into a mixture of mayo, sour cream, shallots, garlic, lemon juice, and sherry vinegar and mashing it all together. I would serve iceberg wedges with dinner, and the cheese would be shared among everyone at the table, I thought, idly dunking a cucumber spear into the bowl. And then another cucumber spear. Nobody was really around for dinner that night, so I stuck the dressing in the fridge, and then I just kept eating it with cucumbers and didn\u2019t share it the next day or the next, and as predicted, I ate the entire wedge of cheese myself, but also a lot of cucumbers.\nAdvertisement\nThen there was the leftover spicy peanut dressing from some noodles, which I used up by dunking cucumbers in it. Some of those cucumbers I wrapped in wasabi seaweed snacks, and some I blitzed with yuzu furikake. Who wants to eat eat? It\u2019s hot. Cucumbers are cool. They\u2019re the popsicles of the vegetable world. They can be halved, seeds scraped out to create a canoe one can fill with leftover flaked salmon or chicken salad, a vessel by which to neatly cast off and float away from the responsibility of making dinner. Bye bye!\nAdvertisement\nMostly I eat Cucumbers With Stuff standing at the counter. Eventually I stopped pretending there would be entrees to support my condiments, and started making blue cheesy dressings and spicy peanut dressings and whatnot with the cucumbers specifically in mind. Radishes, past-their-prime snap peas blanched halfway back to life, leftover steamed broccoli, and cherry tomatoes have at times joined the chat. But now this is starting to sound fancy, like crudites. It is not. It is lazy-times summer leftovers eaten from containers and cutting boards. There is no cute plate or cute presentation, although there could be. But that would be getting away from the spirit of Cucumbers With Stuff, which has no aspirations toward fashion, aesthetics, TikTokery, trend making, audience growing, or follower gaining. There is nothing performative about it, not even performance that is only for oneself, as with girl dinner. \u201cEat like no one is watching,\u201d as Mark Twain definitely once said. Cucumbers With Stuff has zero million views, and it plans to stay that way.\nDevra First can be reached at devra.first@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @devrafirst.",

            "content": "This takes sweet and savory to a whole new level.\nThe latest trend on social media features combining a McDonald's hash brown with the iconic McFlurry dessert and it's taking the internet by storm.\nAustralian TikToker Kelly Arvan ignited the trend when she posted a video in May featuring the menu item hack in her car.\nIn the now-viral video, Arvan can be seen spreading McFlurry mixture over a McDonald's hash brown explaining how the menu hack is a top craving for her.\n\"You know what really upsets me about McDonald's? The fact that the cravings can hit you at any time. When you crave something from McDonald's, nothing else goes close to it, at all,\" she explained as she lathered on the Oreo McFlurry mixture to her hash brown.\nRELATED: The Grimace shake won\u2019t kill you: Why are people on TikTok pretending to die after drinking it?\n\"You were worth waiting for,\" she says as she took a bite.\nObviously, the post sparked some debate among users.\n\"'Just an Oreo McFlurry with hash brows\" like it's a common craving,'\" wrote one user in response.\nAnother user suggested taking the hack even further by dipping it into the pancake syrup. \"Life changing,\" they wrote.\nThe official account for McDonald's Australia stitched Arvan's video endorsing the item writing \"Amazing idea.\"\nIn Arvan's video, she describes the sandwich as \"salty, crunch, potato-ey, sweet,\" rating it a \"10 out of 10,\" in the viral video, which has been viewed over 6 million times as of July 5.\nSince Arvan posted her video, it appears that McDonald's has started to run out of McFlurry's and hash browns as teenagers and adults with the munchies began to flock to nearby locations to try the item.\nAlthough Mcdonald's could not confirm the shortage, it is commonly known that most locations report having their ice cream machines to be broken on a regular basis.\nTikToker @bechardgrave revealed in a video posted on May 29 that she had to drive to \"three different McDonald\u2019s to find one that has both soft serve and hash browns available right now.\"\nWhile it may be too early to confirm, it appears that many are crowning this item as the food hack of the year.\n\"I thought this was going to be trash,\" wrote TikToker Foodandlove5.",

            "description": "The slow yet ongoing trend is helping casual fast food chains attain both a loyal customer-base and fan-base",
            "content": "In late 2019, when the pandemic slowly began wreaking havoc in all sectors of life, the food industry was hit hard as many restaurants struggled to stay afloat. Many had to temporarily shut down their services. Others weren't so lucky and had to shut down operations completely.\nAs dreary as it all was, several restaurant and fast food chains used the opportunity to revamp their marketing techniques. That includes creative social media posts \u2014 namely on TikTok, where several businesses, like Wingstop, SONIC and KFC, meshed Gen-Z humor with food advertising. That also includes new menu offerings. And, better yet, nostalgic menu offerings, such as McDonald's limited-time adult Happy Meals.\nA few major chains even released their own merchandise, from seasonal trinkets to full apparel and accessories, and garnered favorable responses from consumers. People were ecstatic when Pizza Hut \u2014 in partnership with Chain \u2014 the Los Angeles based pop-up culinary collective, released its limited-edition reversible Hut Hat. The reversible bucket hats touted Pizza Hut's iconic red roof on one side and a checkered design with black, white and red on the other. Prior to the Hut Hat, there was KFC Russia's limited-edition bucket hats, which are adorned with the brand's iconic red and white stripe pattern and logos, along with the limited-edition clothing line released by KFC's U.K. wing.\nPerhaps the most notable food accessory sensation is Panera's chic and tasty BAGuette bag, which is essentially an elongated green purse that resembles a loaf of French bread. The bags initially sold out, then were restocked only to sell out again. A few bags were later resold on eBay for more than $200. One seller even listed the bag for an astounding $3,290.\nTime and time again, food merchandise has remained a hit amongst customers and those perpetually online alike. So to keep up with the demand, several restaurant chains have launched online merch shops in an effort to boost sales and provide customers with all the food-themed merchandise they can dream of.\nThe ongoing trend first began in 2021, when Cheez-It launched its self-proclaimed \"first ever online store\" \u2014 fittingly called CheezItHQ.com. The online shop has everything from clothing to drinking accessories to fun miscellaneous items. There's Cheez-It-themed socks, beanies and hoodies and a onesie. There's a can koozie, dual wine sleeves, and a wine tumbler. There's even a fanny pack, an apron, and a fleece blanket.\nOf course, because Cheez-It is a famed snack brand, its online marketplace also carries the signature snacks, like an exclusive Extra Toasty Superfan 4-Pack that includes brand new Extra Spicy, Extra Cheesy, and Cheddar Jack varieties with a box of the original version of Cheez-Its Extra Toasty crackers.\n\"The Cheez-It brand is always looking for new ways to connect with fans, and through this online shopping experience we're offering consumers a new platform to enjoy everything they love about Cheez-It in a fresh, exciting way,\" Jordan Narducci, Kellogg's director of global direct to consumer ecommerce, said in an announcement, per Food & Wine. \"This Direct-to-Consumer site gives us the opportunity to bring future food innovations to market faster than ever before, while also collecting feedback from our consumers in real time.\"\nFollowing suit was Red Lobster, which in November 2022, launched their first digital pop-up shop for the holiday season at RedLobsterShop.com. The limited-time-only shop reopened after three years and sold a slew of unique merchandise specific to seafood and the Red Lobster brand. There's an ugly sweater with an insulated pocket for Cheddar Bay Biscuits, a Cheddar Bay Sleigh Ugly Sweater, a Claw Hoodie, Critter Beanie, and a Red Lobster vintage-style snapback cap. There's also a trio of Red Lobster ornaments along with an ornament dedicated to Cheddar, the rare orange lobster that was found and rescued from a Red Lobster location in 2022.\nIn the same vein as Narducci, Red Lobster's chief marketing officer, Patty Trevino said the restaurant's holiday online shop was all for their loyal fans, who could \"bring their love of Red Lobster home for the holidays.\"\nThe most recent addition to the trio is Panera, which opened its first official online merchandise storefront, The Panera Shop, in April of this year. In addition to the iconic BAGuettes, the store offers other Panera-themed swag, or \"carb couture,\" like mac and cheese tracksuits, \"all my friends are bread\" crewnecks, and even a toddler onesie that reads \"Just Baked.\"\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\nIt's not hard to see that online merch shops are a slow yet ongoing trend in the restaurant industry \u2014 two is a coincidence, but three is a trend, per the age-old adage. As I previously wrote in an April piece on food and fashion, casual fast food continues to be hot and buzzy subjects for content creators, who have garnered significant followings simply by sharing menu hacks, mukbangs and videos of themselves eating their go-to orders from their local Mickey D's. Such content is enticing, attractive and tempting \u2014 much like the food that's being spotlighted. Restaurant-specific merch only adds to that buzzy factor, allowing for restaurants to not only garner a customer-base but also, a fan-base.\nThat, in turn, helps boost revenue and overall sales. In a May 23 announcement, Panera mentioned that it has \"strengthened its leadership in the fast casual segment by expanding its leading digital capabilities, which today account for 53% of total sales at Panera Bread.\" The brand also increased its loyalty base to 53 million members and launched an innovative loyalty subscription model that has resulted in 25% of all Panera transactions now coming from Unlimited Sip Club members. The club is part of Panera's greater reward membership called MyPanera loyalty, which offered exclusive-access to their online store from May 1 through May 7. Other perks include special offers, birthday rewards, discounts and more.\nWhether other casual restaurants will jump on the trend is still to be seen. But it certainly seems pretty likely. Perhaps Pizza Hut will be the next to open up its own online store, where Hut Hats and other pizza-themed paraphernalia will be readily available for purchase.",

            "description": "Canada appears to be a \u201ctrading-down\u201d market, a trend that may persist for some time.",
            "content": "Photo: Pixabay\nCanada appears to be a \u201ctrading-down\u201d market, a trend that may persist for some time.\nRecent data from Statistics Canada on the food retail and service industries and fresh GDP figures paint a dismal picture, especially for those looking to attract more food companies or grocers to our country.\nOur population grew by over three percent last year, yet our GDP increased by less than one percent. While other industrialized economies, such as France and Germany, are experiencing worse economic headwinds, Canada\u2019s economy is highly integrated with the United States, the world\u2019s most robust economy at present.\nDespite our proximity to this economic superpower, the benefits of our geography seem to have stalled. The most alarming aspect of the January GDP numbers is that Canada\u2019s hottest economic sector is currently the public service, while private investments have stalled, primarily due to higher interest rates.\nThe gap in GDP per capita between Canada and the U.S. has widened by 106 percent since 2015, and this trend shows no signs of reversing. In other words, despite our growing population, Canada is becoming poorer, not richer.\nFor those in the food business, this is certainly not good news. Statistics Canada\u2019s reports on food and service sales confirm that consumers are less wealthy while facing higher food and menu prices. As of January 2024, the average Canadian spends $248 a month on food retail sales per capita, down from $258 in January 2023 to $282 in February 2017. These figures are all in real dollars, which makes the situation even worse.\nBased on Canada\u2019s Food Price Report 2024, an individual\u2019s monthly expenditure for a healthy diet should be $339. Again, the current average monthly spending is $248. Until July 2021, Canadians spent more on average than the desired budget to support a healthy diet. Since then, it has clearly been a challenge.\nCanadians are either wasting less or finding alternative ways to source food outside conventional channels like grocery stores, such as dollar stores and non-traditional grocery discounters. Per capita, food expenditures in our country have never been as low as they are now.\nOne might think that grocers are struggling with this situation, but they are readjusting their strategies and putting more pressure on suppliers with higher fees and lower prices. These are perfect conditions for a potential price war later this year, so don\u2019t be surprised if it happens.\nThe data on food service provides a different perspective. On average, Canadians spent $169 at restaurants in January, about the same as last year and an increase from $149 in January 2018. However, these sums are in real dollars. The current retail/service split in Canada is that about 41 percent of all money spent on food is at restaurants, compared to a split closer to 54 percent in the U.S., favouring food service. Given the market\u2019s frugality, it\u2019s surprising to witness such substantial spending at restaurants, where you usually get less value for your money.\nThe days of uncertainty regarding the balance between working from home and working away from home are long gone. The food economy has, for all intents and purposes, normalized. Food inflation is causing Canadians to spend less at grocery stores, which may seem counterintuitive, but this is what the data is telling us. Currently, about 18 percent of all retail dollars are devoted to food, compared to 21 percent in 2017.\nSimply put, the cost of living is a problem for many Canadian households, and trading down is much easier with food. People may be ordering in more often to avoid tips and overpriced beverages, for example.\nAll of this is based on our trust in Statistics Canada, which may not be all that strong. However, Statistics Canada is merely an indicator, and Canadians have no other way to know what is really going on out there other than reading reports from the federal agency. Regardless of how we interpret the data, the numbers are not encouraging.\nThis is what happens when our population grows, but our collective economic wealth stagnates.\nSylvain Charlebois is senior director of the agri-food analytics lab and a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University.\nThis article is written by or on behalf of an outsourced columnist and does not necessarily reflect the views of Castanet.",

            "content": "Photo: Pixabay\nCanada appears to be a \u201ctrading-down\u201d market, a trend that may persist for some time.\nRecent data from Statistics Canada on the food retail and service industries, as well as fresh GDP figures, paint a concerning picture, especially for those looking to attract more food companies or grocers to our country.\nOur population grew by more than 3% last year, yet our GDP increased by less than 1%. While other industrialized economies, such as France and Germany, are experiencing worse economic headwinds, Canada\u2019s economy is highly integrated with the world\u2019s most robust economy at present. Despite our proximity to this economic superpower, the benefits of our geography seem to have stalled.\nThe most alarming aspect of the January GDP numbers is that Canada\u2019s hottest economic sector is currently the public service, while private investments have stalled, largely due to higher interest rates.\nThe gap in GDP per capita between Canada and the United States has widened by 106% since 2015, and this trend shows no signs of reversing. In other words, despite our growing population, Canada is becoming poorer, not richer.\nFor those in the food business, this is certainly not good news. Statistics Canada\u2019s reports on food and service sales confirm that consumers are dealing with less wealth while facing higher food and menu prices.

            "content": "Higher chocolate prices this Easter after bad crops on the other side of the world are just the latest example of disruptions in the food supply chain, a trend experts say consumers are noticing in growing numbers.\n\u201cI think people are becoming more interested in where their food comes from,\u201d said Sophia Carodenuto, a professor of geography at the University of Victoria whose research specializes in global food systems.\nThe past few years have seen a number of high-profile disruptions including a spike in lettuce prices due to flooding in California, rising orange juice prices because of bad crops and higher wheat prices linked to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nThese kinds of disruptive events feel like they\u2019re becoming more common, said Graeme Crosbie, senior economist at agriculture lending firm Farm Credit Canada.\nCocoa futures have \u201cgone vertical\u201d this year, especially in the last four or so months, said Crosbie.\nFutures are a way of measuring commodity prices based on contracts for future delivery, a common way to track prices for commodities like wheat, gold and oil.\nA February report by agriculture-focused co-operative bank CoBank said cocoa prices were nearly 65 per cent higher than a year ago, and New York futures prices were at a 46-year high.\nBad weather and disease in West Africa have damaged crop yields, said Crosbie, hurting supply for the product that goes into Halloween, Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter candy.\n\u201cThe confection business is going to bear the brunt of the margin impact due to cocoa,\u201d Hershey chief financial officer Steven Voskuil told analysts on a conference call in February.\nMost cocoa, especially the cocoa found in many popular chocolate products, comes from West Africa, Carodenuto said. C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, which she said produces about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s cocoa, saw a 30 per cent decline in production over the past year due to climate change and disease, she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the main drivers of ... this huge rise in prices on the commodity markets,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think we're seeing this all over the world, that the rainy season and the dry season are no longer predictable the way that they had been.\u201d\nUnlike some crops, cocoa production is highly concentrated, meaning huge portions of the world\u2019s supply are grown in a handful of areas, said Crosbie. This makes the crop and its supply chain more vulnerable to disruptions.\nCocoa prices don\u2019t directly translate to retail prices, since there are many things other than cocoa that make up a chocolate bar, Crosbie said. But they do have an effect, and he expects retail prices to increase.\nAccording to Statistics Canadainflation data, the price of confectionary items rose more than nine per cent between January 2023 and 2024, compared with overall inflation for food purchased from stores of 3.4 per cent.\nMichael Medline, the chief executive of Sobeys parent company Empire Co. Ltd., told investors earlier in March the grocer is seeing \u201csizable\u201d price increases from some of its suppliers that will \u201cinevitably affect the customer.\u201d\n\u201cThis is largely driven by some commodities like sugar and cocoa continuing to be very volatile due to ongoing climate and geopolitical factors impacting global supply,\u201d he said.\nHigher cocoa prices are an obstacle for manufacturers who have already been struggling with higher sugar prices over the past three years, said senior food and beverage economist Billy Roberts in the CoBank press release.\n\u201cThat could lead to a further erosion of chocolate volume sales and begin to impact dollar sales as well,\u201d he said.\nConsumers are becoming more aware of these kinds of disruptions as food prices have risen across the board, Crosbie said.\n\u201cI think people are certainly paying more attention to the prices themselves, and even how their food is produced.\u201d\nIn a 2021 survey by Deloitte, almost three-quarters of respondents said it\u2019s important for them to understand where their food comes from.\nAnd cocoa is one of many food products that consumers are eyeing more critically.\nCocoa is indigenous to Central America, said Carodenuto, and naturally grows under a canopy of rainforest trees in a diverse ecosystem. But large swaths of rainforest in West Africa have actually been wiped out to make room for cocoa farming, meaning less ecological diversity and more vulnerable crops.\nHigher commodity futures also don\u2019t necessarily dictate the prices farmers are being paid in real time, noted Carodenuto.\nIn Ghana and C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, the largest-producing countries for cocoa, the government creates a minimum price for farmers for the season, she said. But the large multinational companies buying and trading cocoa enter into forward contracts, meaning prices are agreed upon in advance.\nIt takes a lot of manual labour and investment to build a cocoa farm, so farmers need support, especially financially, Carodenuto said.\nThere\u2019s hope that the higher futures prices will lead to more income next year, but it\u2019s not a guarantee, she added \u2014 cocoa prices are cyclical, meaning there will likely be a price crash at some point.\nConsumers looking to make ethical spending decisions face a difficult choice, said Carodenuto, especially given the price gap between premium and ethically sourced chocolate and popular, mass-market confections.\nCarodenuto said shoppers don\u2019t need to stop buying chocolate, but they should educate themselves and seek supply chain transparency by looking for the origin of the cocoa in a product.\nShoppers who can afford to spend more can also seek out businesses that specialize in sourcing ethical cocoa products, she said.\nIn the long term, there is lots of potential for cocoa to be grown in a more sustainable manner, she said, but it could mean lower production in the short term.\n\u201cIt's just that, who's going to pay for that? ... It shouldn't be the most marginalized actor in the system. It shouldn't be the smallholder farmer who has to pay for that.\u201d\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 25, 2024.\n\u2014 With files from The Associated Press\nRosa Saba, The Canadian Press",

            "content": "Higher chocolate prices this Easter after bad crops on the other side of the world are just the latest example of disruptions in the food supply chain, a trend experts say consumers are noticing in growing numbers.\n\u201cI think people are becoming more interested in where their food comes from,\u201d said Sophia Carodenuto, a professor of geography at the University of Victoria whose research specializes in global food systems.\nThe past few years have seen a number of high-profile disruptions including a spike in lettuce prices due to flooding in California, rising orange juice prices because of bad crops and higher wheat prices linked to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nThese kinds of disruptive events feel like they\u2019re becoming more common, said Graeme Crosbie, senior economist at agriculture lending firm Farm Credit Canada.\nCocoa futures have \u201cgone vertical\u201d this year, especially in the last four or so months, said Crosbie.\nFutures are a way of measuring commodity prices based on contracts for future delivery, a common way to track prices for commodities like wheat, gold and oil.\nA February report by agriculture-focused co-operative bank CoBank said cocoa prices were nearly 65 per cent higher than a year ago, and New York futures prices were at a 46-year high.\nBad weather and disease in West Africa have damaged crop yields, said Crosbie, hurting supply for the product that goes into Halloween, Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter candy.\n\u201cThe confection business is going to bear the brunt of the margin impact due to cocoa,\u201d Hershey chief financial officer Steven Voskuil told analysts on a conference call in February.\nMost cocoa, especially the cocoa found in many popular chocolate products, comes from West Africa, Carodenuto said. C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, which she said produces about 40 per cent of the world\u2019s cocoa, saw a 30 per cent decline in production over the past year due to climate change and disease, she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the main drivers of ... this huge rise in prices on the commodity markets,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think we're seeing this all over the world, that the rainy season and the dry season are no longer predictable the way that they had been.\u201d\nUnlike some crops, cocoa production is highly concentrated, meaning huge portions of the world\u2019s supply are grown in a handful of areas, said Crosbie. This makes the crop and its supply chain more vulnerable to disruptions.\nCocoa prices don\u2019t directly translate to retail prices, since there are many things other than cocoa that make up a chocolate bar, Crosbie said. But they do have an effect, and he expects retail prices to increase.\nAccording to Statistics Canadainflation data, the price of confectionary items rose more than nine per cent between January 2023 and 2024, compared with overall inflation for food purchased from stores of 3.4 per cent.\nMichael Medline, the chief executive of Sobeys parent company Empire Co. Ltd., told investors earlier in March the grocer is seeing \u201csizable\u201d price increases from some of its suppliers that will \u201cinevitably affect the customer.\u201d\n\u201cThis is largely driven by some commodities like sugar and cocoa continuing to be very volatile due to ongoing climate and geopolitical factors impacting global supply,\u201d he said.\nHigher cocoa prices are an obstacle for manufacturers who have already been struggling with higher sugar prices over the past three years, said senior food and beverage economist Billy Roberts in the CoBank press release.\n\u201cThat could lead to a further erosion of chocolate volume sales and begin to impact dollar sales as well,\u201d he said.\nConsumers are becoming more aware of these kinds of disruptions as food prices have risen across the board, Crosbie said.\n\u201cI think people are certainly paying more attention to the prices themselves, and even how their food is produced.\u201d\nIn a 2021 survey by Deloitte, almost three-quarters of respondents said it\u2019s important for them to understand where their food comes from.\nAnd cocoa is one of many food products that consumers are eyeing more critically.\nCocoa is indigenous to Central America, said Carodenuto, and naturally grows under a canopy of rainforest trees in a diverse ecosystem. But large swaths of rainforest in West Africa have actually been wiped out to make room for cocoa farming, meaning less ecological diversity and more vulnerable crops.\nHigher commodity futures also don\u2019t necessarily dictate the prices farmers are being paid in real time, noted Carodenuto.\nIn Ghana and C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, the largest-producing countries for cocoa, the government creates a minimum price for farmers for the season, she said. But the large multinational companies buying and trading cocoa enter into forward contracts, meaning prices are agreed upon in advance.\nIt takes a lot of manual labour and investment to build a cocoa farm, so farmers need support, especially financially, Carodenuto said.\nThere\u2019s hope that the higher futures prices will lead to more income next year, but it\u2019s not a guarantee, she added \u2014 cocoa prices are cyclical, meaning there will likely be a price crash at some point.\nConsumers looking to make ethical spending decisions face a difficult choice, said Carodenuto, especially given the price gap between premium and ethically sourced chocolate and popular, mass-market confections.\nCarodenuto said shoppers don\u2019t need to stop buying chocolate, but they should educate themselves and seek supply chain transparency by looking for the origin of the cocoa in a product.\nShoppers who can afford to spend more can also seek out businesses that specialize in sourcing ethical cocoa products, she said.\nIn the long term, there is lots of potential for cocoa to be grown in a more sustainable manner, she said, but it could mean lower production in the short term.\n\u201cIt's just that, who's going to pay for that? ...

            "description": "Wedge salad Christmas trees and 'charcuterwreaths' are trending this year. Whether or not they're practical may not matter.",
            "content": "A food influencer arranges a cheese star at the top of a Christmas tree-shaped display of baby romaine lettuce wedges.\nIn the background, Mariah Carey rallies all holiday-lovers with her annual call to action, belting \"It's time!\" as her Yuletide anthem All I Want for Christmas Is You starts playing. The influencer, with a twinkle in her eye, squirts blue cheese salad dressing out of a squeeze bottle in a criss-cross pattern to look like a garland.\nThe caption reads, \"Everyone needs a good salad this Holiday Season! So why not make it festive?\"\nThe 5.4 million views for this one video on Instagram alone speaks to the appeal of holiday food boards. Hummus wreaths, charcuterie Santas and upright snack-based Christmas trees are being posted and shared across Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok. On TikTok, videos about \"Christmas charcuterie boards\" have racked up 20.9 million views so far.\nSearch results for 'Christmas charcuterie board' on TikTok, where videos have racked up 20.9 million views so far. (TikTok)\nThe Daily Mail says \"buttercream boards\" are this year's trendy festive offering, Marie Claire just proclaimed that \"Charcuterwreaths\" are the latest it food and U.K. magazine The Grocer has declared \"tasty sharing boards\" as one of food retailers' top Christmas trends this year. There are even charcuterie chalets, or meat mansions, because why stop with a gingerbread house?\nIf you can't choose just one, well, you're in luck, because there are also 122.9 million views on trending TikTok videos about Christmas board parties, or \"bring a board night,\" where every guest brings a different-themed board of their own.\nShareable snacks arranged to look like Christmas themes aren't necessarily new (think of the gingerbread house), and the infamous butter board started to trend last year. But the craze this year could be related to high food prices, says Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\nBoards can be shared, which can make them more economical than a meal, he said. For the same reason, Charlebois sees potlucks being more popular this year, too.\n\"Hosting is very expensive,\" he said. \"People are always looking for affordable and imaginative ideas when hosting friends and family.\"\nHave people gone over-board?\nSome of the comments on these videos tell a less enthusiastic story.\nSome point out that it seems difficult to keep the food warm (think of the eggs on a brunch board), that dipping cookies into a shared smear of buttercream seems like a quick and easy way to spread germs and that some boards \u2014 especially the large charcuterie boards loaded with specialty cheeses and meats \u2014 are actually quite expensive to make.\n\"This is cute but not practical. Difficult to eat,\" wrote one viewer on the Instagram salad tree. \"Does everything need to be a damn show,\" wrote another.\n\"Have we taken the board trend too far?\" one woman asked in a reaction video about buttercream boards. \"The thought of cleaning up a board smeared in greasy butter or sticky frosting kind of makes my eye twitch.\"\n\"What bothers me most of all, I think, is that it seems all for show,\" a writer quipped about butter boards last year in Food and Wine magazine. \"For the love of all that is holy, please just use a plate, napkin, or your hands, without reaching for your phone to capture the moment.\"\nSome of the boards and displays are more about show than practicality, Charlebois said, but that doesn't mean the trend is going away anytime soon. For a younger generation, TikTok is the new cookbook, he explained, and lots of people draw their ideas and inspiration from social media.\n\"Things can go overboard at times, no pun intended,\" Charlebois said.\nStores and food manufacturers are looking to take advantage of that potential audience, where individual wedge salad Christmas trees garner 5.4 million views. It's all about being visual, he added.\n\"The whole idea is really to get on people's phones and screens as much as possible.\"",

On Friday (Oct. 13), the car-sharing company Turo launched Drive to Table, a partnership with Michelin Guide that offers, on a first-come, first-served basis, dinner for two at a Michelin star restaurant, a fancy car to get there, and luxury accommodation for a night. Here\u2019s the hard-to-believe part, all-in, it costs $250. The participating Michelin-star eateries are Osteria Giulia and Quetzal in Toronto; and Kissa Tanto and St. Lawrence in Vancouver. The luxury vehicles, hand-picked by the restaurant\u2019s chefs, are various models of Mercedes, Porsche and Audi. And the participating hotels are the Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville and Vancouver\u2019s Fairmont Pacific Rim. They also provide a chef-inspired driving itinerary for the day with their favourite things to do in their respective cities (including tickets to attractions).

The distinctive tile-clad shell exterior wowed the city when it first opened in 1973, and it is still considered one of the most important architectural buildings of the 20th century. This month it\u2019s celebrating 50 years and pulling out all the stops with a weekend of free concerts and events Oct. 21-22, with impromptu performances by Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Bell Shakespeare theatre company, Bangarra Dance Theatre and more. A complete redesign in fall 2022 made the concert hall more accessible and fixed wonky acoustics which often plagued audience sitting in the upper reaches of the house. Visitors can take advantage of the city\u2019s high-end hotel boom as several new properties have opened this year, including W Sydney (opening Oct. 14), Hotel Morris and the Capella, all walking distance from the Opera House.\nHOME\nOpen this photo in gallery: Manufactured entirely in Canada, Rejuvenate sells for $799.99 at plantaform.com.plantaform\nNo soil, no water \u2013 no problem\nFor those with busy schedules seeking a fun way to eat more fresh greens, a Canadian startup has a new solution to grow herbs and produce indoors without soil, regular watering or upkeep \u2013 it all grows with fog. Plantaform harnessed an approach first used by NASA, to create an indoor gardening system that uses \u201cfogponics,\u201d a subset of aeroponics that uses ultrasonic atomizers to break down the water into a fine mist, using 98 per cent less water than conventional systems, CEO Alberto Aguilar told The Globe. Researched and developed in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada, the egg-shaped Rejuvenate can grow up to 15 plants with refills of water and nutrients every two to three weeks. The first units, priced at $799.99 at plantaform.com, are now being used in homes, businesses and restaurants across the country.",

            "content": "Credited with bringing the Indian food trend to the Sault years ago, Neeta Marwah has opened the doors to Noodlebox \u2013 the city\u2019s latest takeout chain that specializes in Southeast Asian street food\nLong-time Indian restauranteur Neeta Marwah celebrated the grand opening of Noodlebox in The Shoppes on TransCanada with friends, family, and dignitaries on July 24, 2023\n1 / 1 Long-time Indian restauranteur Neeta Marwah celebrated the grand opening of Noodlebox in The Shoppes on TransCanada with friends, family, and dignitaries on July 24, 2023\nNeeta Marwah has had a lot of ups and downs throughout her culinary career, but it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s riding a high this summer.\nWidely regarded as a trailblazer for bringing South Asian cuisine to the area, the former owner of Rasoi has started a new business venture with a Noodlebox location at The Shoppes on TransCanada.\nMarwah and her team at Noodlebox opened their doors last Thursday.\nSince then, the service has been non-stop.\n\u201cWe keep selling out of stuff \u2013 the lineups have been constant,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually had to put out a \u2018sold out\u2019 board every day by 6:15 because we just haven\u2019t been able to keep up. We\u2019re amazed at how the community has accepted it.\u201d\nBorn near New Delhi, Marwah originally began making and selling homecooked dishes out of her east-end home back in 2009 \u2013 a time when there were practically no Indian cuisine options in town.\nShe later opened up Rasoi, a take-out storefront in what\u2019s now Antico Ristorant\u00e9. Marwah eventually relocated the business to a dine-in establishment in the downtown core.\nBut in 2020, the pandemic changed everything for the restaurateur.\n\u201cI had to close the kitchen because of COVID,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter we shut down, I was just catering to friends and family, weddings, and baby showers. But eventually I was ready for something new.\u201d\nAfter doing some research and collaborating with friends and business partners Maulik Jariwala and Nilay Patel, the trio headed to Vancouver in 2022 to scope out the Noodlebox chain, which originally started in British Columbia more than 20 years ago.\nBefore she knew it, Marwah became a franchisee.\n\u201cWe actually opened up our first location in Barrie this past May, so the Sault is our second Noodlebox now,\u201d she says. \u201cBy spring of 2024, we want to be in a third location. We\u2019re looking into other northern Ontario towns like Sudbury, Timmins, North Bay, and Thunder Bay.\u201d\nJust less than a week after opening the establishment that specializes in Southeast Asian street food, Marwah has been blown away by the community\u2019s response.\n\u201cWhen I initially started at home, I had backorders then too,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this time, it was quite surprising for me. We\u2019ve had so many cultures who have recently moved in after COVID, and everyone in Sault Ste. Marie has been so open to the different cuisines. It makes me really happy.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even had third-party deliveries like UberEats yet. With the constant crowd we\u2019re getting we\u2019ll probably have to delay it for a couple weeks.\u201d\nMarwah was joined by friends, family, and business colleagues at the restaurant on Monday for an official ribbon cutting ceremony. Mayor Matthew Shoemaker and MP Terry Sheehan even stopped by to help celebrate the occasion.\n\u201cAt the age of 90, my grandma flew alone from India to be here for the opening,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were so blessed to have her here. My husband Rajat and my kids Ahaan and Arsh have been so supportive. I was going through a rough time after I closed down Rasoi. If those three hadn\u2019t pushed me, I honestly wouldn\u2019t have been doing this.\u201d\nWhile she\u2019s taken a step back from her own cooking to focus on Noodlebox, Marwah says the early success of the new business has given her lots of time to be thankful.\n\u201cI\u2019ve built so many relationships in this town \u2013 it\u2019s like a family to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe customers who I\u2019ve known for so many years, and the many friends I\u2019ve made from this work, is very precious to me.\u201d",

With the popularity of cookie companies in the U.S. (like that one ubiquitous one with the big, thick cookies people can't seem to get enough of), the folks at coffee biz Forecast have launched their sweet new enterprise, Wilder Cookies, and its lineup of epic, \"mind-blowing\" cookies.\nForecast, which began in Whistler and expanded in 2021 to Vancouver with the debut of its Mount Pleasant cafe (in the ex-Starbucks Reserve space at 2980 Main St) got Wilder up and running soon after 2023 got underway, selling the cookies inside the coffee shop from the pastry case and by the box for bigger orders.\nThe vision for Wilder is simple: Offer a sweet treat that straddles the line between decadent and something that's more everyday. You might reach for a Wilder cookie as a snack, or it might be more of a special occasion, like something you bring to a dinner party. In fact, Wilder is hopeful their eye-catching blue cookie boxes will be what shows up at your next office team meeting instead of the usual donuts.\nOver a dozen rotating cookie flavours\nThere are over a dozen flavours in rotation at Wilder, which really does mean there is a cookie for everyone. Wilder is making a classic chocolate chunk to its more intense sibling, the S'more (with graham cracker pieces and gooey marshmallow along with those chocolatey chunks), and even sandwich cookies, like one with two rich brownie-like double chocolate cookies with vanilla cream in between.\nSome of the cookies are extra thick - the Birthday Cake one could handily swap in for a celebratory slice with its sprinkles and frosting - and many come with a bit of filling, like the bit of cream cheese frosting inside the red velvet cookie. The Lemon is an absolute standout with just the right amount of sweetness and citrus, it's akin to a cookie version of a perfect glass of homemade lemonade. A nutty breakfast cookie veers away from the sugary add-ons, and a blueberry muffin-inspired option is made for plant-based cookie fans.\nRight now Wilder has the cookies available at all its locations (Vancouver, Whistler, and West Vancouver) and is gearing up to launch ordering via its website soon.\nFollow @wildercookies on Instagram for more info and updates.\nWatch: Wilder Cookies launch in Vancouver...are these the next trend in treats?\nFind more delicious Vancouver food and drink video stories by following VIA's Forking Awesome Tik Tok account",

            "content": "As It Happens 7:05 Attacking paintings with soup isn\u2019t an effective way to fight climate change, says activist\nHurling soup or some sort of damaging food at famous paintings has a become a popular trend among climate activists hoping for a brighter future, but Lucy Whelan says those demonstrations aren't actually having the impact those activists would hope.\n\"It's a kind of spectacle and nothing has really been harmed,\" Whelan, a climate activist and art historian herself, told Nil K\u00f6ksal on As It Happens. \"The problem with climate change right now is that so many people know it's scary, but we're quite complacent.\"\nIn October, protesters Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland made headlines by throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers in London's National Gallery. But the soup caused no discernible damage to the glass-covered painting.\nIn an interview with As It Happens in October, Plummer said that the action she and Holland took was necessary in the shadow of the climate crises.\n\"Right now, there's 33 million people displaced by floods in Pakistan. Thousands of people are dying of starvation in Somalia due to extreme famine from crop failure,\" said Plummer.\nThis photo from Italian news agency Ansa, shows climate activists from Last Generation and a security guard by The Sower, an 1888 painting by Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh, after activists threw pea soup at it on Nov. 4. (ANSA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\"And it took two young people throwing soup at a painting to get more people talking about the climate crisis, [more than] the millions of lives have been destroyed by climate disasters.\"\nWhen Whelan first saw what Plummer and Holland had done, she was shocked. But she says, while she wholeheartedly agrees with the intention behind the protest, she feels it's a lose-lose scenario.\n\"Either the soup or the acidic liquid that's chosen is actually going to damage the artworks, in which case, I think that's the tragedy. It makes the protesters look like hooligans who are not interested in preserving things for the future, which they obviously are,\" said Whelan.\n\"Or it's not going to damage the work \u2026 then what we have is something that looks shocking, but actually it just makes us all go, 'Oh, it's fine,' \u2026[which] is exactly the kind of thinking that we need to stop being quite so good at.\"\nMaking a difference\nOther famous pieces of art have been hit as well. In late October, mashed potatoes were chucked Claude Monet's painting Les Meules, and someone smashed chocolate cake on a waxwork figure of King Charles.\nIn Canada, protesters with Stop Fracking Around, a group demanding an end to the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project, poured maple syrup onto Emily Carr's 1934 painting Stumps and Sky at the Vancouver Art Gallery on November 12.\n\"Her painting Stumps and Sky \u2026 is a lament of ecological destruction and her art actually paid attention to Indigenous peoples. She cared about all that binds us to the world. She seemed just the wrong person,\" said Whelan.\nProtesters said they chose the painting because the fallen trees depicted the kind of environmental destruction they are trying to prevent. But Whelan says that instead, protesters should be more thoughtful about the pieces they target.\nThis photo provided to media from the group Stop Fracking Around shows Erin Fletcher, left, and Emily Kelsall, right, in front of the Emily Carr painting 'Stumps and Sky,' at the Vancouver Art Gallery on Saturday, Nov. 12. (Stop Fracking Around)\n\"At least think about making some seriously disruptive attacks on art that celebrates consumption and economic growth,\" said Whelan.\n\"I think we need to be more thoughtful, not more art historical, about about what is the target of activism.\"\nWhelan says she is on the protesters' side. As a climate activist herself, she's tried to make meaningful changes and taken part in protests.\nShe's spoken to her local politicians in Cambridge, England, and talked with neighbours about how they can do things differently to protect the environment.\n\"There will be so many people watching attacks like this saying, 'oh, I support action on climate change. I really do. But just not this not attacks on art.' And I would encourage anyone who says that to make that real, to translate that into action,\" said Whelan.\n\"If you do support action on climate change, [and] you don't want to see it like this, contact your counselors, do something you do approve of. Walk the talk.\"\nProduced by Kate Swoger.",

The recipe that kicked it all off, which intentionally reads like a guide, is his \u201cHerbed\u201d Butter with Warm Bread. In Six Seasons, McFadden recommends seasoning the butter base with flaky salt, pepper and chili flakes, then scattering with greens, herbs, grated citrus zest, and chopped pickles or capers.\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content In Doiron\u2019s viral version, which has been viewed more than eight million times, she sprinkles over flaky salt, lemon zest, edible flowers, fresh herbs, ground coriander and cardamom before drizzling with honey and swiping with warm bread. Photo by Justine Doiron As with snack boards of other stripes \u2014 whether charcuterie or cheese \u2014 you don\u2019t need a recipe to build a butter board. Start with softened butter on a cutting board or plate, season with salt and layer the toppings of your choice. (Doiron considers flaky salt and citrus zest essential; the rest is up to you.) When coming up with flavour combinations, she thinks of her \u201cdream bread and butter recipe\u201d \u2014 such as honey, figs and toasted sage, or a \u201cdeconstructed garlic bread\u201d with garlic confit and chili oil \u2014 and makes it on a larger scale.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content For ease of cleanup, Doiron suggests putting a sheet of wax paper on the cutting board before applying the butter. And though she drags a piece of warm bread directly through the butter in her video, you can serve the board with knives (as you would a cheese board). Doiron credits the appeal of the butter board to how customizable it is. And though she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d with how it has caught on, the role of viral content creator is unfamiliar. \u201cThis is the first trend I\u2019ve ever \u2018created,\u2019 but I see a lot of accounts that are very trend-focused. And that\u2019s great and it\u2019s really fun, and it\u2019s really fun to pick up on ideas and customize things,\u201d says Doiron. \u201cI\u2019ve never been trend-focused. So, in the face of creating a trend, it\u2019s a whole new world for me.\u201d\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content She topped her first butter board with fresh figs, walnuts and hot honey, then made two others using creamy cheese as a base (Greek salad on feta, and goat cheese). A fan of charcuterie as well, Andreeva has considered making a combination board: part butter, part charcuterie, part something else. \u201cI don\u2019t want to choose,\u201d says Andreeva, laughing. \u201cI love all the boards.\u201d Doiron doesn\u2019t feel the need to play favourites either. A butter board offers customization and plenty of room for creativity, but so does a spread of cured meats and cheeses. With different textures, tastes, presentation and ingredients, snack boards are not an either-or scenario. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the next charcuterie board,\u201d says Doiron. \u201cBoth can coexist peacefully because they both offer something different.\u201d\nShare this article in your social network\nGet the latest from Laura Brehaut straight to your inbox Sign Up\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.",

In Six Seasons, McFadden recommends seasoning the butter base with flaky salt, pepper and chili flakes, then scattering with greens, herbs, grated citrus zest, and chopped pickles or capers.\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content In Doiron\u2019s viral version, which has been viewed more than eight million times, she sprinkles over flaky salt, lemon zest, edible flowers, fresh herbs, ground coriander and cardamom before drizzling with honey and swiping with warm bread. Photo by Justine Doiron As with snack boards of other stripes \u2014 whether charcuterie or cheese \u2014 you don\u2019t need a recipe to build a butter board. Start with softened butter on a cutting board or plate, season with salt and layer the toppings of your choice. (Doiron considers flaky salt and citrus zest essential; the rest is up to you.) When coming up with flavour combinations, she thinks of her \u201cdream bread and butter recipe\u201d \u2014 such as honey, figs and toasted sage, or a \u201cdeconstructed garlic bread\u201d with garlic confit and chili oil \u2014 and makes it on a larger scale.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content For ease of cleanup, Doiron suggests putting a sheet of wax paper on the cutting board before applying the butter. And though she drags a piece of warm bread directly through the butter in her video, you can serve the board with knives (as you would a cheese board). Doiron credits the appeal of the butter board to how customizable it is. And though she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d with how it has caught on, the role of viral content creator is unfamiliar. \u201cThis is the first trend I\u2019ve ever \u2018created,\u2019 but I see a lot of accounts that are very trend-focused. And that\u2019s great and it\u2019s really fun, and it\u2019s really fun to pick up on ideas and customize things,\u201d says Doiron. \u201cI\u2019ve never been trend-focused. So, in the face of creating a trend, it\u2019s a whole new world for me.\u201d\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content She topped her first butter board with fresh figs, walnuts and hot honey, then made two others using creamy cheese as a base (Greek salad on feta, and goat cheese). A fan of charcuterie as well, Andreeva has considered making a combination board: part butter, part charcuterie, part something else. \u201cI don\u2019t want to choose,\u201d says Andreeva, laughing. \u201cI love all the boards.\u201d Doiron doesn\u2019t feel the need to play favourites either. A butter board offers customization and plenty of room for creativity, but so does a spread of cured meats and cheeses. With different textures, tastes, presentation and ingredients, snack boards are not an either-or scenario. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the next charcuterie board,\u201d says Doiron. \u201cBoth can coexist peacefully because they both offer something different.\u201d\nShare this article in your social network\nGet the latest from Laura Brehaut straight to your inbox Sign Up\nLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.",

            "description": "A packed ham sandwich or a leafy salad might be your ordinary weekday lunch, but it is turning into a hot trend called \u201cwhite people food\u201d in China.",
            "content": "BEIJING \u2014 The plain ham sandwiches, simple salads and other American-style packed lunches that fill office refrigerators don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cInstagram.\u201d But they\u2019re a social media sensation in China, where they have their own hashtag: #WhitePeopleFood.\nThe trend appears to have started in May, when a Chinese social media user posted a video that quickly went viral of a fellow train passenger in Switzerland pulling lettuce leaves from a bag and layering them with ham and mustard.\n\u201cIs there anything more \u2018white people food\u2019 than this?\u201d the caption read.\nThe term pokes fun at the casual, on-the-go way people eat in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in the West. Compared with the warm, flavorful and elaborately prepared food people from China are used to, meals made with a handful of cold and unseasoned ingredients can seem underwhelming or just plain inedible.\nDiscussions of \u201cwhite people food\u201d on Chinese social media are filled with witty and withering descriptions: \u201cFood of suffering.\u201d \u201cA meal to maintain vital signs.\u201d \u201cWhat death must feel like.\u201d\nBut as a cuisine it does have its advantages, as stressed-out young workers are discovering in cities across China.\n\u201cI had been having sandwiches for lunch for more than half a year,\u201d said Gao Duan, a 30-year-old playwright in the northern port city of Tianjin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a strong smell and it\u2019s convenient to eat in the office.\u201d\nEventually Gao had enough of the daily sandwiches, which she said she ate \u201cjust to get through the afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no point eating good food in the workplace, because food should be divine and enjoyed properly,\u201d she said.\nOn Xiaohongshu, China\u2019s equivalent of Instagram, users are rushing to post their own versions of \u201cwhite people food,\u201d a topic with more than 13 million views that is reminiscent of the \u201csad desk lunch\u201d meme from the 2010s.\nOne user told her followers that she was enjoying her bagel sandwich stuffed with ham, cheese and rocket leaves. Another showed a boxed lunch featuring cucumber and tomato, as well as ready-made boiled eggs and potatoes, captioned \u201cno heating, no cutting, no seasoning, done in two minutes.\u201d\nThough \u201cwhite people food\u201d is far from a novelty in China, which has had Western fast-food chains since the 1980s, the social media trend is driven by changes in how people are living, as well as the eye-catching hashtag.\n\u201cThe name looks a bit politically incorrect,\u201d said Cao Yu, who studies food culture at Jinan University in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to be offensive.\u201d\n\u201cPeople simply think it doesn\u2019t look very tasty,\u201d Cao added.\nA typical Chinese lunch includes staple foods such as rice or noodles and a few warm dishes made with multiple ingredients, spices and cooking techniques from frying to stewing to braising. From start to finish, preparation can easily take 30 minutes to an hour.\nThat was easier when most workers, many of them working for state-owned companies with their own canteens, could depend on extended lunch breaks long enough for a hearty meal and an early-afternoon nap.\nBut China\u2019s modern \u201c996\u201d work culture \u2014 working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week \u2014 leaves little time to make or eat a complicated meal.\n\u201cYoung people want to save more time for themselves,\u201d Cao said. \u201cWhen you realize you can just eat a carrot raw, a door to a new world opens.\u201d\nSimplicity isn\u2019t the only reason \u201cwhite people food\u201d has come to look more appealing.\nLi Qiaoying, a 26-year-old marketing consultant based in Shenzhen who enjoys yoga, Pilates and dance cardio, said it aligns with her idea of a healthy diet and helps her keep fit.\n\u201cIt is lighter, unlike the deep-fried or stewed Chinese dishes,\u201d she said. \u201cFood that\u2019s too oily or strong is a burden to the body.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also considered cheaper by urban workers facing high living expenses and record youth unemployment. Making a Western-style boxed lunch costs less than 20 yuan ($2.80), Li said, compared with 30 yuan ($4.20) for takeout and 100 yuan ($13.80) to eat at a restaurant. In a country where the average worker makes less than 9,000 yuan ($1,240) a month, the difference adds up quickly.\nOther young professionals, considering the effort that would be required to make a proper Chinese meal, are so exhausted they just can\u2019t be bothered \u2014 a reflection of a growing movement to minimize work, social activities and other exertion that is known in China as \u201clying flat.\u201d\n\u201cFood is an important part of Chinese culture,\u201d said Miao Jia, assistant professor of sociology at NYU Shanghai. \u201cBut many young people will sacrifice taste since they only eat to survive.\u201d\n\u201cWhite people food\u201d still has many detractors in a country with a long and rich culinary tradition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd for an adult to eat this for daily nutrition,\u201d said Xianglan Huo, a college student in the southern city of Kunming. \u201cThe portion is not even enough for my cat.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too cruel to the body,\u201d Huo said. \u201cI prefer rich cuisines.\u201d\nBut it also has its defenders \u2014 even when it comes to taste.\nAlice Dong, a 34-year-old office worker in Beijing, said she loves her salad lunches because they resemble some of the cold dishes she ate growing up in northeast China.\n\u201cMy mom used to mix radish, cucumber and shredded potato with salt, vinegar and chili sauce,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, Western salad is just a change of a few ingredients and sauce.\u201d",

            "content": "The most recent data from Nielsen and Numerator showed that packaged food sales are in an accelerating trend as pricing continues to help offset volume weakness.\nUBS analyst Cody Ross noted Kraft Heinz (KHC), Campbell Soup (CPB), Mondelez International (MDLZ), General Mills (NYSE:GIS), TreeHouse Food (THS), and Hostess Brands (TWNK) all saw accelerating sales growth on a 2-yr CAGR basis as well.\nLooking ahead, the outlook is not so positive for the food stocks. Ross thinks the biggest question facing the sector is whether there will be a soft landing to lower organic sales growth or a hard landing with a period of flat to negative growth.\n\"A soft landing likely requires companies to step up investments in the form of innovation and marketing to drive volume growth as price gains wane. A hard landing will likely be the result of accelerating elasticity (to more normalized levels) coupled with private label share gains.\"\nRoss thinks the strong May Nielsen and Numerator data tilts the scale to a soft landing, although the issue is not seen being settled until, but acknowledges this debate will likely take many ups and downs before it is ultimately late 2023 into 2024 when the price contribution to sales begins to roll off significantly. For now, UBS recommends stocks with the highest quality portfolios and the greatest visibility to earnings beats.

(Juan Figueroa / Staff Photographer)\nEasy homemade hot honey \u2014 and 10 great ways to use it\nStore-bought hot honey is nearly twice the price of plain honey, but it\u2019s a cinch to make in just a few minutes. Besides saving you money, there\u2019s a huge advantage to making your own: You can customize the spiciness. If you find your batch too spicy, add a bit more honey; if it\u2019s not spicy enough, a few drops of Sriracha or other hot sauce will kick up the heat instantly. If you\u2019re timid, make a half-batch of hot honey for your first run-through. Below is a simple recipe, followed by many ways to use the honey.\nSimple Hot Honey\n1 cup honey\n2 to 3 teaspoons chile flakes\n1 tablespoon cider vinegar\nBig pinch of salt\nSriracha or other hot sauce (optional, if spicier profile is desired)\nIn a small pot over medium-low heat, combine honey, red chile flakes, cider vinegar and salt. When mixture begins to simmer, immediately reduce heat to lowest setting and maintain a bare simmer for 3 to 5 minutes (longer for spicier honey), watching closely so that it doesn\u2019t boil. Remove from heat and allow honey to cool. If you like, strain out the chile flakes through a mesh sieve; the longer the flakes steep in the honey, the spicier it gets. Taste, and if you find it too spicy, add more plain honey; if it\u2019s not spicy enough, add a few drops of Sriracha sauce or other hot sauce. Store in a tightly covered glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.\n10 ways to use hot honey\n1. Toss with roasted vegetables like Brussels sprouts or sweet potatoes.\n2. Pour it over baked brie.\n3. Drizzle it on a pizza topped with pepperoni or any other salumi.\n4. Drizzle it on fried chicken, or waffles with fried chicken tenders.\n5. Slather it on buttered biscuits or cornbread.\n6. Add it to stir-fried dishes at the tail end of cooking.\n7. Drizzle it over whole milk ricotta and serve with grilled bread.\n8. Nestle a small bowl of it into a charcuterie and cheese board, accompanied by bread or crackers.\n9. Drizzle it over grilled pineapple, pears or sliced strawberries.\n10. Use it in place of simple syrup in cocktails.",

            "content": "Water nausea, as it turns out, is actually a lesser-understood phenomenon, so I spoke with Dr. Supriya Rao, MD \u2014 who is quadruple board-certified in internal medicine, gastroenterology, obesity medicine, and lifestyle medicine \u2014 to further explain these experiences.\nAs Dr. Rao puts it, there are several reasons why one could experience nausea after drinking water, and though it's most common in bariatric patients (specifically those with gastric bypass), it could feasibly happen to anyone. One reason could be due to preexisting dehydration. \"Patients may have some type of electrolyte imbalance because, with bypass patients, they're not absorbing all the vitamins that they normally would,\" she told BuzzFeed.\n\"Or, it could be the way that surgery is done, from a nervous system point of view. You're changing things around in the gut, and it's possible that the nerve endings are sending signals to make you feel nauseated, and that having something sweet would make it more palatable. Sugar, salt, and fat are more palatable ingredients in general.\"",

            "title": "Why are so many fast food brands obsessed with bucket hat merch lately?",
            "description": "Pizza Hut is the latest brand to jump on the fun and funky trend with its limited-edition, reversible Hut Hat",
            "content": "Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, there's no denying the fact that bucket hats, the cylindrical-shaped accessory, has made a big comeback.\nFashion experts over at Who What Wear, The Hollywood Reporter and Cosmopolitan know it's true. And so do major fast food brands, who have been launching their collection of bucket hat merchandise like clockwork. Back in July 2019, KFC Russia partnered with Russian streetwear label Mam Cupy to launch their limited-edition bucket hats, which are adorned with the brand's iconic red and white stripe pattern and logos. To the naked eye, the hats may be mistaken for an overturned bucket of the chain's signature 8 pc. fried chicken meal. But a closer look reveals that the accessory is indeed meant to be worn on your head, rather than served on the dining table.\nFollowing suit was KFC's U.K. wing, which partnered with lifestyle brand Hype to create a limited-edition clothing line inspired by their iconic logo. The complete collection included bralettes, joggers, tees, puffer jackets, backpacks, bucket hats and, even, dad caps with the slogan \"Bargain Bucket\" embroidered across the front. Here in the states, Wendy's linked up with \"Rick and Morty\" in celebration of its sixth season to release a few limited-time meal options and themed merch, like bucket hats, sweatpants, and hoodies. McDonald's also released its McFlurry Bucket Hat, which is currently on sale for just $9.99.\nThe latest fast food brand to join the bandwagon is Pizza Hut, which partnered with Chain, the Los Angeles based pop-up culinary collective, to release its limited-edition reversible Hut Hat. Per Pizza Hut, \"The Hut Hat is a reversible bucket hat with one side resembling Pizza Hut's iconic red roof and the other a checkered design with black, white and red, resembling the lampshades hanging within Pizza Hut restaurants nationwide.\"\n\"Those Pizza Hut Tiffany lamps are some of the most iconic pieces of New Americana design,\" said Nicholas Kraft, a co-founder at Chain, \"They elicit such joy and fond memories \u2014 and let's be real: they kinda look like bucket hats all on their own.\"\nThe nostalgia factor has been a major reason why bucket hats are making their resurgence in 2023. Thanks to TikTok fashion, celebrity street style and Gen Z's fascination with the Y2K aesthetic, the accessory \u2014 which was a divisive trend circa the '90s \u2014 is acquiring a new generation of fans. It's also worth mentioning that bucket hats are incredibly versatile: Depending on the fabric it's made of, the hat can either be a spring or summer accessory (if it's made from a light material like denim or cotton) or a winter accessory (if it's made from a thicker material like wool or terry cloth). And, it's effortlessly chic. As Vogue's Christian Allaire wrote:\nBut even in classic black, paired with a dressier ensemble, I've learned that the bucket adds just the right amount of extra, without going overboard. It adds instant personality to a look in a way that a dad cap simply cannot. And so what if people think you look like you're trying to dress like a teen? If the topper is good enough for Rihanna, it's good enough for all of us.\nEssentially, bucket hats are simple, convenient and timeless \u2014 which are, surprisingly, the same traits that make fast foods so popular amongst consumers. The hats also greatly resemble popular food items, making them the perfect accessory to don when you're not quite hungry but are still thinking about your favorite cravings. A simple bucket hat can be transformed into a bucket of fried chicken. Sprinkle in a bit of imagination and the hats can also be transformed into a cake, a cupcake and, yeah, even a gumdrop!\nWant more great food writing and recipes?

In recent years, fast food has become a hot and buzzy subject for content creators, who have garnered significant followings simply by sharing menu hacks, mukbangs and videos of themselves eating their go-to orders from their local Mickey D's. Such content is enticing and attractive and tempting. So, what better way to enhance those posts than with some fun and funky fashion.\nIt will be interesting to see what other fast food brands will jump on the trend next. Personally, we'd love to see a hat that looks like Auntie Anne's blue-and-yellow pretzel cups (and smells faintly like their signature cinnamon sugar pretzel). As for now, we'll wait patiently for that release and, in the meantime, try our best to secure a Hut Hat.",

            "content": "Mooove over, regular butter.\nVodka butter is the boozy, viral new spread intoxicating social media \u2014 and making a splash at dinner parties.\nChef and food blogger Carolina Gelen wowed the internet by whipping up the recipe for her TikTok followers \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to churn out at home.\nThe clever condiment maker combined one stick of butter with a shot of vodka in a food processor, whipping the mixture to a velvety texture.\n\u201cIt comes together in less than five minutes,\u201d Gelen assured in the 36-second clip.\nAfter perfecting her fat-and-acid blend, she spread the butter liberally over a crisp baguette.\nThe inspiration for the concoction came while sipping a favorite cocktail, Gelen told The Post.\n\u201cI love a dirty martini, so I tried making a dirty martini butter with green olives and vodka, but the olives ended up being overpowering flavor-wise,\u201d Gelen said. \u201cSo I tried the recipe again, without olives, and the result was amazing.\u201d\nGelen gleaned inspiration from her favorite drink, a dirty martini, but found the green olives too overpowering. Courtesy of Carolina Gelen\nThe chef-blogger\u2019s vodka butter recipe can be whipped up in mere minutes. Courtesy of Carolina Gelen\nAnd while the sky\u2019s the limit, Gelen suggested looking to the briny deep for the perfect pairing \u2014 say, a nice, salty tinned fish like sardines, or, for something more luxurious, a dollop of caviar.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t spread this on toast for breakfast but would serve it as an appetizer with crusty bread, anchovies, herring, sardines or caviar,\u201d she said.\nThe delicious discovery is just the latest example of butter\u2019s moment in the spotlight.\nLast year, butter boards \u2014 an indulgent riff on the charcuterie board, featuring butter garnished with sauces, fruits and spices \u2014 became an overnight sensation, with the hashtag #ButterBoard gaining more than 234 million views on TikTok. Many users and healthcare professionals scoffed at the idea of a full plate of butter.\nSome NYC chefs have already been experimenting with the new butter sensation. It has just enough balance, and eaters will hardly taste the vodka, they say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got this surprise kick that pairs perfectly with a hot piece of cod, salmon or swordfish,\u201d cookbook author and recipe developer Jason Goldstein told The Post.\nGelen says a salty fish is the perfect pairing to compliment the salty sweetness of the butter, and acidity of the vodka. Courtesy of Carolina Gelen\nAnd while Goldstein advises that eaters invest in quality butter and vodka, he also admitted that it\u2019s all pretty good.\n\u201cYou could do [this] with any butter you have \u2014 it\u2019s pretty versatile. If you\u2019re doing it to put on top of fish, use salted. If you\u2019re going to smear it on toast, then add your own salt to regulate the perfect balance,\u201d he said.",

            "description": "I tried the latest viral TikTok food trend, cottage cheese ice cream, and it's a sweet, satisfying, protein-packed treat.",
            "content": "You\u2019ve seen the chickles, the pancake spaghetti and the blue cookies, but TikTok\u2019s latest recipe obsession is cottage cheese \"ice cream.\" This unlikely-sounding treat has hundreds of taste-testers singing its praises, no ice cream maker required. And most versions have just a couple of base ingredients, two cups of cottage cheese and two tablespoons of honey or maple syrup, with infinite mix-ins like cookie bits, fruit, cocoa powder and peanut butter.\nDepending on the flavorings, a one-cup serving comes in around 300 calories, packing at least 25 grams of protein and almost 200 milligrams of calcium.\nThe top-viewed video on TikTok is @paigelindgren\u2019s banana cream pie tutorial, with 1.2 million views. She suggests adding graham cracker crumbs to make the pie flavor pop.\nGet Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston\u2019s newsletters.\nTikToker @lainiecooks has a strawberry cheesecake version with about a million views and a game-changing method: Pour the mix right back into the original cottage cheese container for easy peasy freezing.\nDespite rave reviews and an excellent nutritional profile, a few commenters are worried about the repercussions when TikTok has a new ingredient darling. \u201cCottage cheese is the new cauliflower,\u201d quipped user @shekinah, and @leeannwithswan answered, \u201cCottage cheese gonna be $25.\u201d\nI actually agree with some of the eye-rolling over adding cottage cheese to everything, because there is such a thing as too much protein, and in my registered dietitian opinion, a lot of TikTok food trends lean hard into toxic diet culture. Nutritional tunnel vision can lead to forgetting to include other important nutrients like fiber and vitamins, and even unhealthy patterns like restriction or orthorexia.\nCottage cheese can be pretty unpredictable when added to recipes that are cooked, too. Not only do high-protein foods like eggs not need more added to make them healthy, but scramble them with cottage cheese just a few seconds too long, and you\u2019ll get watery eggs interspersed with something like mozzarella.\nI like the idea of this recipe because it takes a very sugar-heavy dessert and makes it more balanced, easier to indulge without overdoing it. It also doesn\u2019t rely on ultra-processed protein powders or diet sweeteners.\nThe apparent originator of the trend has a similar take on healthy eating. Kenzie Akers (@kenzieakers), Indiana-based wellness advocate and mom of three, got the idea to freeze her usual high-protein shakes and cheesecake dips all the way back in March 2022.\nI caught up with Akers to talk about her creation, and she says she started increasing her protein and moderating her carb intake as part of a weight loss strategy. This kind of sweet, indulgent snack with a healthy and filling twist is one of her favorite techniques, but she\u2019s a big believer in a real-food approach.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the entire journey of restriction and substitutions, and after all that, you still want the real stuff! So, I just eat the real stuff, and fit it into a healthy diet overall,\u201d she says. When she posted a video of a fast-food meal recently, commenters called it a \"cheat day,\" but Akers says she wants people to know it\u2019s not cheating to her \u2014 it\u2019s part of a balanced and joyful lifestyle. I can get behind that!\nCommenters\u2019 feedback has been almost totally positive, so she has a series of other cottage cheese recipes coming up, including a \u201cbrownie batter\u201d dip.\nNaturally, I couldn't resist trying it myself. One tip \u2014 if you have already used a bit of cottage cheese for something else, you\u2019ll have room to blend everything right in the container with a blade guard-equipped immersion blender, but be sure to hold it securely and vertically for safety.\nI tried several batches, blending in melted chocolate chips, fresh berries, bananas and vanilla extract. Both full-fat and 2% cottage cheese worked well. The thick texture makes it incredibly easy to fold in a perfect swirl of jam or marshmallow spread, and chopped nuts or fruit pieces don\u2019t sink to the bottom.\nAdding the graham cracker bits to a double scoop of chocolate and strawberry jam swirl yielded the best ice cream I\u2019ve ever made at home.\nExpect a little bit of a salty tang that isn\u2019t characteristic of traditional ice creams. A lot of the flavors are described as \"cheesecake,\" and I really found that to be the best description.\nMy favorite flavor? Churro! I melted sugar with cinnamon in a skillet, spread it on a silicone mat to cool and harden, and stirred it into a honey-vanilla base. The added sweetness and crunch are the perfect foil for the creamy complexity of cultured dairy.\nEverything I tried worked, but it\u2019s not entirely foolproof. Some additions, like sugar or alcohol, can inhibit solidifying if you add too much, and liquid ingredients might form larger ice crystals. One of the keys is to nail down freezing time for the best texture; it varies by freezer and container, but two to three hours is typical. If you find it\u2019s frozen too hard, resist the temptation to pop it in the microwave for a few seconds, because when you heat cottage cheese too much, you may find bits of a mix-in you\u2019d prefer to miss: mozzarella!\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com.

            "content": "Ask any Korean what their favorite street food is and, most likely, at the top of the list will be tteokbokki \u2014 the pillowy soft rice cakes doused in a sticky red pepper sauce. Now the dish is gaining traction in the U.S. thanks to a confluence of Korean popular culture and accessibility.\nPre-packaged versions of the food have started popping up at national wholesalers like Costco, online sales are spiking and tteokbokki-specific restaurants are expanding. There also was, of course, that moment BTS singer Jimin helped make it a trending item on social media when he was spotted eating it at a Seoul food market. Tteokbokki is also the preferred food of Ji-Young, Sesame Street\u2019s\u2019 first Asian muppet.\nO\u2019Foods, a global producer of Korean pantry staples, started selling instant pre-packaged tteokbokki in the U.S. in October 2021 through online retailers such as Walmart and Amazon. Its sales of the rice cake have increased 450% over the last year.\n\u201cOur bestselling product on online platforms has always been gochujang, but our tteokbokki product line has already become our runner-up within a year,\u201d O\u2019Foods company representative Justin Park told NBC News.\nHe added that tteokbokki has outpaced popular Western snacks at times, with his product and Quaker alternating for first and second bestsellers in the \u201crice cakes\u201d category at Amazon\u2019s Grocery and Gourmet Foods section.\nO\u2019Foods, which sells packaged tteokbokki, has had a 450% increase in sales over the last year. O'Foods\nIts sentimental value is not lost among second-generation Korean Americans, even as new clientele discover the comfort food.\n\u201cOne of my earliest memories is when I was 9 or 10 years old, I was in Korea for the summer, and my cousins took me to a jip (store) right by their house and I just remember crying, so mae-yo (spicy),\u201d said Joanne Lee Molinaro, creator behind the Instagram account The Korean Vegan and cookbook by the same name.\n\u201cI think that is a rite of passage that many Korean Americans have. As a result, its popularity kind of exploded. It\u2019s certainly exploded in my own blog,\u201d Molinaro said. \u201cPeople would print out that recipe and take it to the Korean grocery store and say, \u2018I want to make this.\u2019\u201d\nKorean food has long been gaining awareness with Western audiences. Bibimbap was an early Goop \u2014 and Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s \u2014 favorite recipe in 2009. Korean barbeque joints in urban areas regularly command long lines. But the proliferation of Korean entertainment \u2014 much of which features critical plot lines hinging on eating (think ram-don in \u201cParasite\u201d) \u2014 has helped accelerate interest in dishes beyond Korean fried chicken and K-Bbq. And Netflix has turned Korean food shows and dramas into global sensations.\nYumi Yang pulls tteokbokki rice cakes apart before they are chopped up at San Su Jang rice cake shop in Los Angeles in February 1997. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file\n\u201cRecently the boom of Korean music, K-pop, Korean dramas, Korean movies, and anything Korean culture has become a lot more popular and now accepted as something hip and cool and something to try out,\u201d said Hooni Kim, the first chef to receive a Michelin star for Korean cuisine. \u201cSomebody who has never tried Korean food but loves BTS and loves the movie \u2018Parasite,\u2019 it\u2019s much easier for them to try Korean food.\u201d\nKim sells a packaged version of tteokbokki in his premium food store in New York City, Little Banchan Shop. He sources his dduk from the rice cake maker and bakery Yedang, which he swears by. \u201cThis is the best place. I\u2019ve tried every dduk from every purveyor,\u201d he said.\nOnce a delicacy served in royal courts, the tubular rice cakes date back to the Joseon period in Korea, where it was traditionally cooked in a sweet soy sauce and beef. It is thought to be first documented in the 19th century cookbook \u201cSiuijeonseo,\u201d though its modern-day form has evolved to be red, sticky and sweet, simmered with hard boiled eggs and fish cakes. That too, however, is changing as new innovations bring new flavors.\nIn New York City, the restaurant Witch Toppoki is betting on rice cakes\u2019 growing appeal by bringing a wider selection to the public. The restaurant opened its first location in Flushing, Queens, in December 2022, and a second in nearby Bayside in February 2023.\nWitch Toppoki in New York City opened its second location in February. Youyoung Lee\nThe menu highlights a variety of rice cakes, from sweet potato to wheat to corn, and unconventional sauces like rose and carbonara.

            "description": "As American shoppers stomach soaring food prices, they are cutting back on purchases of other goods, such as toys, clothing and housewares, in a challenging trend for retailers.",
            "content": "Summary\nSummary Companies Food retailers benefit from rocketing prices\nChoosy shoppers seek discounts on clothing, housewares\nHome improvement sales head down\nFeb 23 (Reuters) - As American shoppers stomach soaring food prices, they are cutting back on purchases of other goods, such as toys, clothing and housewares, in a challenging trend for retailers.\nCommentary this week from executives at Walmart (WMT.N) and other retailers shows how Americans are shifting their shopping habits and hunting for bargains in the face of the highest inflation in a generation.\nAt Walmart, the world's biggest retailer by revenue, Americans are still spending but are more \"choiceful, discerning, thoughtful\" about what they buy, its global Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told analysts.\nHigher prices on food led to soft sales of electronics, toys, home and apparel in the most recent quarter at Walmart. McMillon said he believed inflation on dry groceries and items made for immediate consumption would remain high \"for a while\".\nThe average cost for food consumed at home climbed 11.3% in January from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed.\nThat was nearly 5 percentage points above the overall rate of inflation, among the widest gaps since the 1970s. Food cost increases have outstripped broader inflation for nearly a year.\n\"Food inflation has been the most stubborn of all the categories,\" Walmart's U.S. CEO John Furner said.\nCoresight Research predicts annual grocery retail sales will grow by around $500 billion between 2022 and 2030.\nSharp sales declines in categories other than food are forcing retailers like Target (TGT.N) to slash prices on everything from toys to electronics.\n\"If I were a (U.S. retail) CFO right now, I'd probably have to be talking about the most conservative guide possible,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. The firm holds about $7 million in Walmart shares and recently sold its investment in Target.\nHOME IMPROVEMENT CRUNCH\nWalmart can withstand the challenge more than other retailers, investors said, as groceries make up a bigger share of its sales.\nWhile groceries comprise 56% of Walmart sales, they make up about 20% of sales at Target, which depends more on home furnishings, apparel and beauty.\nSales for last fiscal year at Target, which reports on Feb. 28, are expected to rise 2.7%, according to estimates, well below the 6.7% rise that Walmart reported.\n\"There is still risk in the market ... but for Walmart it is able to manage that risk and that's why we own it.

The Indonesian digital news outlet Kompas reported that at least 10 cases of people suffering food poisoning from the dessert had been found, appearing to cite the Indonesian Ministry of Health's Director of Environmental Health.\nThe Indonesian outlet Kontan published a timeline with information about multiple individual cases, including one where a child reportedly had to be operated on because the snack made a hole in his stomach.\nThere are multiple health risks to consuming these kinds of liquid nitrogen-fueled snacks, and doctors have warned about them before. The liquid nitrogen is so cold it can burn the skin and body, and it can also cause asphyxiation, Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor at Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Health, told Today.com.\nIn 2018, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about dragon's breath, noting that injuries had \"occurred from handling or eating products prepared by adding liquid nitrogen immediately before consumption, even after the liquid nitrogen has fully evaporated due to the extremely low temperature of the food.\"\nIndonesia's Ministry of Health has warned mobile vendors against selling the snacks and advised other precautions be put into place, like informing children in schools, the Guardian reported. The Ministry of Health did not respond to Insider's request for comment.\nThe food \u2014 essentially candy (or sometimes cereal) dipped in liquid nitrogen, which gives it a striking visual look as smoke billows out of the dessert \u2014 has been featured in YouTube videos and tweets for years. It's called \"dragon's breath\" because it makes smoke flow out of the consumer's mouth and nostrils.\nLiquid nitrogen-coated candy is also a popular phenomenon on TikTok, with a trend hashtag about it (\"dragon's breath\") amassing over 200 million cumulative views. However, Insider was only able to find one recently uploaded video of a child indulging in the candy, and it had less than a thousand views.\nTikTok did not respond to Insider's request for comment about whether the platform has already taken action against clips featuring the candy.\nTiktok has often been blamed for dangerous trends that didn't actually originate on the platform, or were similarly widespread on platforms like Facebook or YouTube.\nA purported trend where kids would place magnets in their mouths to make fake piercings was attributed to TikTok despite the fact that variations of this game have existed for decades, and Insider couldn't find any indication that the craze found traction on the platform.",

            "description": "The clip of Ollie follows the trend of social-media videos showing pets being offered human food to see how gentle they will be when they accept it.",
            "content": "While most dogs can be characterized for their never-ending appetite, this particular golden retriever is more than happy to savour his food and take it one tiny bite at a time.\nA video shared on TikTok by @goldenbearollie on January 11 shows the dog being offered a sandwich when his owner was supposed to be eating it herself.\nAfter eyeing up the snack and waiting for permission from his owner, Ollie gently leans forward to take a tiny nibble of the sandwich, cautious not to take too much. The caption for the video reads: \"You can take a small bite... was he gentle though?\"\nTherapy dog trainer and writer for Good Dog Swag Michelle Lehr spoke to Newsweek about this behavior: \"This gentle way of eating is not only cute, but it also speaks to the innate manners and politeness that these dogs possess.\n\"Many dogs will exhibit this type of behavior when eating. This is because dogs have instinctual manners that govern their behavior around food. In the wild, dogs are pack animals and they compete for food. Therefore, they have developed manners, such as taking small bites to avoid conflict and aggression around food.\"\nLehr continued about why golden retrievers specially are so good at this trend: \"Golden retrievers are well known for their friendly, gentle and trainable nature, and have a strong desire to please their owners.\n\"Their gentle way of eating is a reflection of their well-mannered nature and their desire to please their owners.\"\nThe video follows a trend of social-media videos showing pets being offered human food to see how gentle they will be when they accept it. There's little doubt that Ollie managed to grasp this with his incredibly gentle nature.\nThough this viral trend might be cute, it's important not to feed a dog too much unhealthy food. According to figures by VCA Animal Hospitals, obesity is the most common disease that can be prevented in dogs in North America.\nIt's thought that 25 to 30 percent of all dogs are obese, and 40 to 45 percent of dogs aged between 5 and 11 years old weigh more than they should. The risks of obesity in dogs include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and osteoarthritis, so it's important to manage a dog's weight correctly.\nThe video of Ollie on TikTok, has received over 1 million views and more than 270,000 likes in little more than a single day. The owner even replied to one comment: \"This was the first time Ollie ever tried a sammy. He's just a gentle boy.\"\nOllie has warmed many hearts with his gentle eating, with comments on the video including: \"That was gentle but definitely not a small bite!\"\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

            "description": "Here's what you may want to consider before whipping up a butter board of your own.",
            "content": "In an unexpected twist, butter seems to be back on the menu. After years of being a maligned ingredient that many people shied away from, butter has now become the latest food trend on social media, thanks to the recent popularity of \"butter boards.\"\nThese are sort of the meat-free equivalent of a charcuterie board. Butter is whipped then spread onto a chopping board, sprinkled with a variety of toppings \u2014 from sweet to savory \u2014 and served with an accompaniment of choice (such as bread or a toasted baguette).\nBut although they may be delicious, butter is still full of saturated fat \u2014 which many of us know can be harmful to our health. Here's what you may want to consider before whipping up a butter board of your own.\nIs butter really that bad?\nButter is made from cream, the fat-rich part of milk. While it's usually made from cow's milk, it can also be made from other milks such as goat milk.\nThe reason that butter has been seen as a no-go for so many years is because it's one of the ultimate sources of saturated fat. Butter contains around 80% fat, of which about two-thirds is saturated fat. It contains little else nutrient-wise.\nSaturated fats should be avoided in large amounts as they're linked with many health problems, including heart disease and shorter life expectancy. Clinical trials have also shown that saturated fats can have a negative effect on blood cholesterol levels.\nWhen it comes to butter on its own, it appears that eating it has a relatively small or neutral effect on the risk of heart disease. But research that compared butter to olive oil (another source of saturated fat) found that butter can increase levels of LDL cholesterol, which is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol as it's linked to greater risk of heart disease.\nBut the majority of the butter many of us consume in our diets comes from other foods such as biscuits, cakes and pastries. Alongside butter, these foods tend also to contain high amounts of sugar, while being low in other nutrients. High intakes of these types of foods is also linked with greater risk of heart disease.\nOverall, sharing a butter board with friends every now and then is unlikely to cause much harm to your health. But doing it often, or eating very large quantities, could raise cholesterol levels and increase your risk of cardiovascular disease somewhat.\nIt's also worth bearing in mind what toppings you serve your butter board with. Certain foods (such as processed or cured meats) also contain saturated fats and should only be enjoyed occasionally.\nButter alternatives\nSince butter is very calorific and fat-rich, some people may want to look at using butter alternatives for the base of their butter board.\nThe first substitute many people might look to is margarine. Margarine is chemically very similar to butter. Depending on the product though, it only contains around 40%-70% fat, making it a lighter alternative with a possibly similar taste.\nIn the past, the processes needed to make margarine solid resulted in the production of trans fats, which have been linked to increased risk of heart disease. But these processes have since been improved so margarine no longer contain trans fat. So it may be a good option for people wary of the amount of fat they consume.\nAnother alternative people may look at using is ghee, also sometimes known as clarified butter. A staple of Indian cooking, this is still made from milk, but the fat is much more concentrated as most of the water has been simmered away. This means it won't have the same creamy texture as butter.\nGrass-fed ghee is as rich in saturated fats as butter. It also contains naturally produced trans fats. However, these trans fats are different to the industrially produced types which are bad for our health. But since ghee contains more calories than butter, it may not be the best choice for a butter board, especially if you're looking for the best flavor.\nCultured butter may also be a choice for your butter board. This is made from cream which has been fermented like yogurt. However, no research to date has looked at whether the probiotics in cultured butter provide the same health benefits as those in yogurt and other fermented foods. Nutrition-wise, it contains the same amount of fat and calories as regular butter.\nAll in all, butter is not bad. But since it's very high in calories and cholesterol, you may want to try not to have too much. Sharing a butter board with some friends or loved ones every now and again is unlikely to have any long-term negative impact on your health.\nDuane Mellor, Lead for Evidence-Based Medicine and Nutrition, Aston Medical School, Aston University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

            "content": "Those viral butter boards are spreading everywhere, but one woman is serving up her own version of the food trend: rice boards.\nSoo-Jin Kim\u2019s video, which has garnered a combined 5 million views on Instagram and TikTok, shows her remixing a butter board recipe from food TikToker Sam Schnur with her own Asian version of the shareable spread.\nButter boards took off on social media last month and are a riff on the charcuterie board, featuring heaping mounds of butter spread on a serving dish, sprinkled with different toppings and served with bread or crackers.\nKim, 44, who grew up in Korea and now lives in Florida, said she wasn\u2019t too interested in a board full of butter, but it gave her the idea to make a platter of her favorite foods.\nKim, who works as an event planner and gained a following posting food videos, first shared her board earlier this month. It includes a bed of sticky rice and slices of fried Spam. She adds sliced Korean pickled radishes called danmuji, toasted sesame seeds, Sriracha and mayo, which is scooped up with sheets of nori.\nHer video starts, \u201cPOV: you don\u2019t get the butterboard so you make your own board.\u201d Kim slaps the sushi rice onto her platter. The butter board recipe says to \u201cmake a charcuterie board but for butter,\u201d so Kim does the same and adds fried Spam. The text then says, \u201cButterboard: Add stuff,\u201d and as Kim makes her own version, the text on the screen says, \u201cRice board: Add Asian stuff.\u201d\nShe said she\u2019s had a lot of other videos go viral but never gained as much traction from those.\n\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t going to do poorly because the butter board was trending. But I didn\u2019t know I was going to get that many comments and engagement as a result. That was what shocked me more,\u201d she said.\nButter boards started appearing on TikTok after Justine Doiron, who runs a food account on the app, posted the video Sept. 15. The board was inspired by a recipe in Portland, Oregon-based chef Josh McFadden\u2019s James Beard Award-winning book \u201cSix Seasons.\u201d\nTikTok users showed their love for Kim's idea in the comments of her video.\n\u201cSpam fried rice is a staple in my household so I am absolutely here for this,\u201d one user commented.\n\u201cIts a yes for me,\u201d another user wrote.\nAfter her initial rice board went viral, Kim made and posted another \u2014 this time inspired by a dish her late mother made her as a child. It included pan-seared cocktail sausages, fried eggs, spring onions, toasted sesame seeds and soy sauce.\n\u201cMy mom used to make me rice with soy sauce and a fried egg to shut me up from crying and it worked every time,\u201d she joked. \u201cI did add the mini sausages to it. If I was a good girl, she used to give me sausages. So it really was that.\u201d\nKim said she cooks because she loves to eat, not because she loves to cook.\n\u201cMy videos tend to contain simple recipes, and the rice board is an example of a family dish almost anyone can make.

            "content": "PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The arrival of veggie meat dishes on Parisian steakhouse menus with names such as \"tenderloin\" and \"flank\" poses a challenge to French government efforts to ban meat names for plant-based products.\nThe global market for plant-based meat-like food has been booming, attracting major investment from global agrifood groups hoping to capitalise on a trend towards healthy eating, including less red meat. And new technologies are making such products look ever more authentic and appetising.\nThe products of Redefine Meat made their debut in a Parisian restaurant this week after the Israeli startup firm struck a deal with importer Giraudi Meats to drive European distribution of its \"New Meat\" steak cuts produced on 3D printers.\nHowever, the French government, backed by farmers and the meat industry, has been trying to ban the use of meat and fish names for plant-based protein food in an effort to avoid confusion over the trendy meat alternatives.\nFrance's highest administrative court suspended a government ban due to take effect this month, saying it gave operators too little time to adapt. The agriculture ministry told Reuters it was working on a new text taking into account the court recommendations, without giving a time frame.\nIt remained unclear whether the ban would apply to imported products and to menus or be limited to French labels.\n\"Maybe it will require us to be a bit more creative in the names we use but it won't stop customers,\" Redefine Meat chief executive Eshchar Ben-Shitrit told Reuters at Giraudi Meats' Beefbar near the Champs Elysees avenue.\nPlant-based meat, often made from pea or soybean protein, has attracted massive investments from agrifood giants such as Nestle or Archer-Daniels-Midland, though soaring inflation and recession worries recently have encouraged some consumers to return to cheaper animal meat products.\nBeyond Meat, one of the world's leading plant-based meat producers, cut its revenue forecast last week.\nRedefine Meat sells its New Meat in almost 1,000 restaurants in Israel, Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, and they currently pay about $40 per kilo for its steak cuts. The company targets 3,000 restaurants by year-end, Ben-Shitrit said. (Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide Editing by Gareth Jones)\n\u00a9 Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.

            "content": "SAVANNAH, Ga. \u2014 Having chicken for dinner? If so, sear it, fry it or braise it but do not cook it in NyQuil, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) warns.\nThe cautioning comes after a recent social media challenge that encourages viewers to cook chicken in NyQuil (acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine) or another similar OTC cough and cold medication, presumably to eat.\n\u201cBoiling a medication can make it much more concentrated and change its properties in other ways.\u201d the FDA said in a written statement. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t eat the chicken, inhaling the medication\u2019s vapors while cooking could cause high levels of the drugs to enter your body. It could also hurt your lungs. Put simply: Someone could take a dangerously high amount of the cough and cold medicine without even realizing it.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a social media challenge promoted unsafe behaviors. Earlier, there was a challenge that urged people to take large doses of the allergy medicine diphenhydramine, to try to induce hallucinations.\nAnother viral challenge involving medicine turned out to be deadly. In the challenge, people were encouraged to take large doses of diphenhydramine to try to induce hallucinations. This medicine is sold in many products, including some under the brand name Benadryl.\nThe challenge was reportedly blamed for the hospitalization of at least three Texas teens in May 2020 along with the death of a 15-year-old Oklahoma girl in August 2020.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advised parents to speak with their teens about which challenges are trending on social media or at school are suggest the following:\nStart a conversation by asking your kids about the biggest challenges they\u2019ve heard about in their circle of friends. Ask them (calmly and without judgment) what they think about the challenge. This helps build the skill of judging risk by talking about what could happen to someone who takes the challenge. You can still exercise your parental options such as limiting contact with certain kids or making specific activities off limits.\nIf your child is interested in participating in a challenge, use open-ended questions to encourage them to think through each step of the challenge. Ask them to consider the worst outcome. Ask them to think about why they would do it, and if it\u2019s worth it. Are likes and comments worth hours in the emergency department?\nBe sure to \u201cfriend\u201d your kids on social media, which can help you keep in touch with what goes on in their day-to-day lives. Watch their stories for clues about what is going on in school and with their friends.\nAsk questions about school trends, friends and fads. It\u2019s important to keep the lines of communication open and avoid passing judgment. Instead, calmly discuss the dangers in those choices.\nIf you believe your child has taken too much medication and is hallucinating, can\u2019t be awakened, has had or is having a seizure, has trouble breathing, has collapsed, or is showing other signs of drug misuse, call 911 to get immediate medical attention. Or contact poison control at 1-800-222-1222 or online.\nIf you have a question about a medication, including an OTC drug, call your health care provider or pharmacist or the FDA.\n\ud83d\udcf2 Download the FOX4 News app to stay updated on the go.\n\ud83d\udce7 Sign up for FOX4 email alerts to have breaking news sent to your inbox.\n\ud83d\udcbb Find today\u2019s top stories on fox4kc.com for Kansas City and all of Kansas and Missouri.",

The recipe that kicked it all off, which intentionally reads like a guide, is his \u201cHerbed\u201d Butter with Warm Bread. In Six Seasons, McFadden recommends seasoning the butter base with flaky salt, pepper and chili flakes, then scattering with greens, herbs, grated citrus zest, and chopped pickles or capers.\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content In Doiron\u2019s viral version, which has been viewed more than eight million times, she sprinkles over flaky salt, lemon zest, edible flowers, fresh herbs, ground coriander and cardamom before drizzling with honey and swiping with warm bread. Photo by Justine Doiron As with snack boards of other stripes \u2014 whether charcuterie or cheese \u2014 you don\u2019t need a recipe to build a butter board. Start with softened butter on a cutting board or plate, season with salt and layer the toppings of your choice. (Doiron considers flaky salt and citrus zest essential; the rest is up to you.) When coming up with flavour combinations, she thinks of her \u201cdream bread and butter recipe\u201d \u2014 such as honey, figs and toasted sage, or a \u201cdeconstructed garlic bread\u201d with garlic confit and chili oil \u2014 and makes it on a larger scale.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content For ease of cleanup, Doiron suggests putting a sheet of wax paper on the cutting board before applying the butter. And though she drags a piece of warm bread directly through the butter in her video, you can serve the board with knives (as you would a cheese board). Doiron credits the appeal of the butter board to how customizable it is. And though she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d with how it has caught on, the role of viral content creator is unfamiliar. \u201cThis is the first trend I\u2019ve ever \u2018created,\u2019 but I see a lot of accounts that are very trend-focused. And that\u2019s great and it\u2019s really fun, and it\u2019s really fun to pick up on ideas and customize things,\u201d says Doiron. \u201cI\u2019ve never been trend-focused.

The recipe that kicked it all off, which intentionally reads like a guide, is his \u201cHerbed\u201d Butter with Warm Bread.

            "content": "Meal planning is a food trend quickly becoming more popular. Here\u2019s a simple way you can get started and start reaping the benefits.\nPreparing meals for the week ahead is a food trend that\u2019s grown in popularity for its time-saving, health and lifestyle benefits. As daunting as the idea of cramming a week\u2019s worth of work into a matter of hours can be, healthy meal prep doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\nHow do I start food prepping?\nIf you\u2019re new to meal planning and meal prepping, there are few simple steps you can take to get started. Eatingwell.com says the first step to success is determining the best prep method for you.\nCommon meal prep methods include:\nMake-ahead meals that can be reheated,\nBatch cooking and freezing multiple portions of a recipe,\nIndividually portioned grab-and-go meals, or\nPreparing ready to cook ingredients so meals can be cooked efficiently before serving.\nOnce you have your meal prep method in place, you can determine your menu and schedule some time to get cooking!\nThe next step to meal prep made simple is to take stock and shop. Take inventory of what you have in your kitchen and stock up on pantry staples like canned beans, rice, grains, dried herbs and broth.\nFinally, it\u2019s time to prepare and store your food. Eatingwell.com suggests making the most of your food prep time by beginning with foods that require the longest cooking time. It is also important you are mindful of storage life and keep prepared and cooked items organized with date labels.\nWhat is the best app for meal planning? Find out here.\nWhat foods last the longest when meal prepping?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a grocery list that won\u2019t spoil, here are a few time-tested ingredients to incorporate into your meal plan:\nBeans\nSweet potatoes\nRice\nBoiled eggs\nKale\nOats\nRoasted vegetables\nCanned tomatoes\nCanned corn\nIs meal prepping good for weight loss?\nCan you lose weight from meal prepping? The short answer is - it depends. Meal prep supports healthy eating when you incorporate healthier ingredients and more variety into weekly menus. You control what goes into the dish and it all comes down to health choices.\nRecipes, along with meal-prep strategies, can easily be modified to meet each individual or family's needs, dietary restrictions, and preferences.\nWhat are the easiest foods for meal prep?\nIf you\u2019re interested in what to cook that will last all week, Top10.com compiled a list of easy and delicious recipes for prepared meals that can be made in bulk to last the whole week.\nBlack bean and sweet potato enchiladas\nBlack bean sweet potato enchiladas make for a hearty vegetarian dish that supplies five servings in just 20 minutes of prep time. The enchilada sauce calls for salsa verde, which can be made at home or bought pre-made at the store. As an added bonus, this recipe includes modifications to make it gluten-free or vegan.\nBaked ziti\nBaked ziti allows for a lot of personalization: You can choose your preferred meat (Italian sausage, ground beef or pork, or a vegan alternative), your favorite store-bought pasta sauce (or make your own), and pasta shape. The recipe recommends using different fresh herbs depending upon the season, from basil in the summer to rosemary in winter. This dish is easy to freeze, so be sure to prep a little extra.\nVegetarian chili\nQuick and easy to make in bulk, and very freezer-friendly, this vegetarian chili is vegan, gluten-free, and packed with protein thanks to the beans and quinoa. Cumin and chili powder are key to the flavour of this recipe. Finish it off with a variety of toppings like sour cream, Greek yogurt, cheese, or chips, depending on your dietary preferences.\nSlow cooker sesame beef\nWith just a few inexpensive ingredients, slow cooker sesame beef is simple and budget-friendly. All you need to start this delicious dish is a 3-quart or larger slow cooker and 15 minutes of prep time. When the meat is finished cooking, pair it with your choice of sides like broccoli and rice, use it to top a cabbage salad, or load up a few taco shells.\nChana masala\nChana masala is a simple, delicious Indian dish featuring chickpeas. The recipe yields two servings perfect for a dinner or spread across workweek lunches. Chana masala can be spooned over jasmine or basmati rice, paired with naan bread, or served on its own.\nBaked mini frittatas\nFor fans of breakfast anytime, baked mini frittatas fit the bill. Following the recipe as given, with bacon, broccoli, and cheese, each frittata is only 127 calories; however, you can incorporate any ingredients you'd like. The recipe makes a dozen frittatas using a muffin tin: plenty for a week's worth of breakfasts.\nRed beans and rice\nRed beans and rice may take a little longer to fix than other dishes, but it's worth the time for six servings of a freezer-friendly meal. Quick-soaking the beans will decrease prep time. This recipe offers flexibility, from the type of beans and sausage to the level of spice in the dish. Ingredients for this meal are inexpensive and full of protein and fibre.\nSouthwest shrimp and corn succotash\nSouthwest shrimp and corn succotash is a healthier twist on a southern classic. The dish is given a TexMex flair by using black beans instead of lima beans, along with spice-rubbed shrimp and jalapenos.\nPro tip: Cut down on your prep time by purchasing shrimp that are already peeled and deveined. The entire dish can also be made using one pan, making clean-up quick and easy.\nSausage and kale lentil stew\nPacked with fresh veggies, sausage and kale lentil stew is quick and easy to fix with cook and prep time totalling just over an hour. The recipe makes six servings, so be sure to freeze any extra in order to enjoy it a month or two down the road.\nMoroccan pot roast\nMoroccan pot roast is a new twist on an old favourite: traditional beef chuck roast flavoured with nontraditional ingredients including eggplant, honey, and mint. This dish pairs especially well with flatbread or couscous. The slow cooking takes about seven hours, but when it's done you're left with eight servings that will last all week or can be frozen for a delicious meal later on.",

You control what goes into the dish and it all comes down to health choices.\nRecipes, along with meal-prep strategies, can easily be modified to meet each individual or family's needs, dietary restrictions, and preferences.\nWhat are the easiest foods for meal prep?\nIf you\u2019re interested in what to cook that will last all week, Top10.com compiled a list of easy and delicious recipes for prepared meals that can be made in bulk to last the whole week.\nBlack bean and sweet potato enchiladas\nBlack bean sweet potato enchiladas make for a hearty vegetarian dish that supplies five servings in just 20 minutes of prep time. The enchilada sauce calls for salsa verde, which can be made at home or bought pre-made at the store. As an added bonus, this recipe includes modifications to make it gluten-free or vegan.\nBaked ziti\nBaked ziti allows for a lot of personalization: You can choose your preferred meat (Italian sausage, ground beef or pork, or a vegan alternative), your favorite store-bought pasta sauce (or make your own), and pasta shape. The recipe recommends using different fresh herbs depending upon the season, from basil in the summer to rosemary in winter. This dish is easy to freeze, so be sure to prep a little extra.\nVegetarian chili\nQuick and easy to make in bulk, and very freezer-friendly, this vegetarian chili is vegan, gluten-free, and packed with protein thanks to the beans and quinoa. Cumin and chili powder are key to the flavour of this recipe. Finish it off with a variety of toppings like sour cream, Greek yogurt, cheese, or chips, depending on your dietary preferences.\nSlow cooker sesame beef\nWith just a few inexpensive ingredients, slow cooker sesame beef is simple and budget-friendly. All you need to start this delicious dish is a 3-quart or larger slow cooker and 15 minutes of prep time. When the meat is finished cooking, pair it with your choice of sides like broccoli and rice, use it to top a cabbage salad, or load up a few taco shells.\nChana masala\nChana masala is a simple, delicious Indian dish featuring chickpeas. The recipe yields two servings perfect for a dinner or spread across workweek lunches. Chana masala can be spooned over jasmine or basmati rice, paired with naan bread, or served on its own.\nBaked mini frittatas\nFor fans of breakfast anytime, baked mini frittatas fit the bill. Following the recipe as given, with bacon, broccoli, and cheese, each frittata is only 127 calories; however, you can incorporate any ingredients you'd like. The recipe makes a dozen frittatas using a muffin tin: plenty for a week's worth of breakfasts.\nRed beans and rice\nRed beans and rice may take a little longer to fix than other dishes, but it's worth the time for six servings of a freezer-friendly meal. Quick-soaking the beans will decrease prep time. This recipe offers flexibility, from the type of beans and sausage to the level of spice in the dish. Ingredients for this meal are inexpensive and full of protein and fibre.\nSouthwest shrimp and corn succotash\nSouthwest shrimp and corn succotash is a healthier twist on a southern classic. The dish is given a TexMex flair by using black beans instead of lima beans, along with spice-rubbed shrimp and jalapenos.\nPro tip: Cut down on your prep time by purchasing shrimp that are already peeled and deveined. The entire dish can also be made using one pan, making clean-up quick and easy.\nSausage and kale lentil stew\nPacked with fresh veggies, sausage and kale lentil stew is quick and easy to fix with cook and prep time totalling just over an hour. The recipe makes six servings, so be sure to freeze any extra in order to enjoy it a month or two down the road.\nMoroccan pot roast\nMoroccan pot roast is a new twist on an old favourite: traditional beef chuck roast flavoured with nontraditional ingredients including eggplant, honey, and mint. This dish pairs especially well with flatbread or couscous. The slow cooking takes about seven hours, but when it's done you're left with eight servings that will last all week or can be frozen for a delicious meal later on.",

            "title": "Why gardening has more staying power than a typical trend",
            "description": "Gardeners are reaping more than just food and flowers while pursuing their new hobby",
            "content": "Kaleena Lawless, who lives in Petitcodiac, N.B., became an avid gardener during the pandemic and loves working in her new sprawling vegetable garden.VIKTOR PIVOVAROV/The Globe and Mail\nThere is a growing desire amongst people to grow their own food, to aid pollinators, to disconnect from screens and reconnect with the Earth. Supply chain shortages and inflation amplified this desire, culminating in many Canadians planting seeds in their gardens \u2013 and now those gardeners are hooked.\nChristian Lajoie, who owns Montreal-based Natural Seeds Canada, says that a significant number of these gardeners are parents gardening with their children, despite often being novices themselves.\nArley McNeney, a university instructor based in Vancouver, is one of those parents. McNeney began gardening in March this year after she and her daughter moved into a new place with a garden box in the front yard.\n\u201cWe\u2019d had a bit of a rough week in March, and I just went to the plant store [and] I bought some seeds,\u201d she explains. McNeney also bought some broccoli and strawberry plants, which she thought she would plant in neat rows, but things didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\u201cMy daughter just scattered the seeds,\u201d says McNeney. \u201c[Now] it\u2019s kind of grown into a tangle that we call \u2018The chaos garden.\u2019 \"\nDespite its name, McNeney describes the chaos garden as a source of tranquility and connection for her family \u2013 something she needed after her divorce which prompted her move and led her to lose most of her possessions, including her grandmother\u2019s dishes and coffee table.\nMcNeney\u2019s grandmother was an avid gardener, and gardening is a way for her to make up for that loss. \u201c[I realized] I\u2019m not going to get those things back, they\u2019re gone, but I can still connect with my grandmother in this one little, tiny way, and make us feel a bit more at home,\u201d says McNeney.\nGardening has also forged connections between McNeney and her neighbours, who offer her plant-related advice since gardening is often trial and error.\nSeed sales jumped during the pandemic as more people picked up gardening. Though sales are subsiding somewhat this year after remaining strong in 2021, many neophyte gardeners are sticking with their new hobby, says Benjamin Hutchinson, operations manager at Ontario Seeds Company.\nKaleena Lawless is another new gardener. She bought a house in Petitcodiac, N.B. in 2018: The house came with an acre of land that\u2019s now home to Lawless\u2019 sprawling vegetable garden. She picked up gardening when the pandemic lockdowns limited access to spaces like indoor gyms.\n\u201cI have definitely tried everything; I have a big garden tower where last year I did all vegetables like lettuce and cherry tomatoes,\u201d she says.\nTo reduce gardening mistakes, many new gardeners flocked to local gardening groups on Facebook, such as Gardening in New Brunswick Canada, which Lawless joined two years ago and now moderates. The group now has 19,000 members and counting.\nJennifer Jobin, a seasoned gardener and an administrator of the Manitoba Gardeners Facebook group, which has 24,000 members and counting, says the group enables new gardeners to learn and improve.\n\u201cI built the group and it\u2019s become a very large group,\u201d says Jobin. Gardeners appreciate the ongoing learning as well as the community. Lawless, for example, often shares extra harvest with her neighbours.\nThough gardening enriches gardeners\u2019 lives, it is often inaccessible to many Canadians \u2013 sometimes literally, since it requires physical labour and at least a bit of land.\nAs a result, many Canadians are now gardening on their apartment balconies as well as in community gardens. Amanda Johnson, who works with the Yellowknife Community Garden Collective, recalls that in the spring of 2020, all the plots across the collective\u2019s six community gardens filled up quickly. Interest in the lots has persisted, she adds.\nNew gardeners seem to be particularly interested in growing their own food, according to Jim Ternier, founder of Saskatchewan-based Prairie Garden Seeds. Ternier mentions an increase in sales of fruit and vegetable seeds \u2013 carrots and sweet corn are especially popular \u2013 as well as wildflowers to support pollinators. Lajoie is also selling a lot of saffron, which, to many of his customers\u2019 surprise, can grow in Canada.\nMany Canadians developed green thumbs that they have continued to nurture because, not only is doing so therapeutic and connects them to their communities, but the fruits, as Lawless says, are bountiful.\n\u201cThe garden is a gift that keeps on giving,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more you put into it, the more you keep getting back.\u201d",

            "title": "Inflation means more food insecurity for Canada's post-secondary students",
            "description": "The stereotype of students living off ramen shows how normalized this trend has become, writes Abby Jenkins",
            "content": "The rate of inflation in Canada climbed to 8.1 per cent this past June, reaching a 39-year high.\nThis increase in the cost of living is affecting the health and livelihoods of people across the country, and students are especially vulnerable.\nFifty-three per cent of young Canadians aged 15 to 29 reported being very concerned about their ability to afford housing or rent. This concern hints at the sacrifices students must make due to the cost of living: making rent or buying food.\nAs many as 40 per cent of Canadian post-secondary students are food insecure, meaning they do not have reliable access to enough affordable and nutritious food.\nMost students have a relatively small income during the year, which might come from a summer job, part-time work or informal jobs like babysitting. As expenses continue to increase with inflation, many students lack financial savings and do not have the capacity to work alongside their studies.\nAs a student myself, I can see how rising costs will continue to worsen food insecurity in the student population. Between the costs of tuition, textbooks and rent, many students have little to nothing left in their budget to buy nutritious and fresh food.\nThe popular stereotype of students living off dry packaged goods like cereal and ramen to keep them functioning illustrates just how normalized student food insecurity has become.\nThese foods are not sufficient for supporting optimal health. For many students, options like fresh produce are too expensive, perishable, and require prep time and cooking skills, which many students do not have.\nFood is essential for health and well-being, and should never be something students are forced to sacrifice. We need to vote and encourage institutions to have better support for students. These supports need to include: lower tuition costs, university supported breakfast programs and affordable produce markets, and greater OSAP (Ontario Student Assistance Program) funding, so students are not forced to use their food money for rent.\nAbby Jenkins is a policy and communications summer student at York Region Food Network. She is going into her fourth year at Western University studying global development, and is interested in holistic, sustainable and long-term approaches to systems issues.\nRELATED STORIES Ontario's 2023 rent increase will make more households food insecure\nSHARE:",

            "content": "What are we looking for?\nSustainable dividends from the top trend in food sales \u2013 snacks.\nThe screen\nKellogg Co. announced this week plans to unlock shareholder value by breaking itself into three parts: global snacking, North American cereals and plant-based foods.\nUnderlying the decision is the food giant\u2019s push to better focus on increasingly lucrative \u2013 and expanding \u2013 snack food demand. That segment, in fact, brought in about 80 per cent of the company\u2019s 2021 revenue. The breakup allows the snacks business to solely focus on still-strong pandemic demand and the broader consumer shift to on-the-go eating.\nOur search started with a list of North American firms with strong snack brands. All successfully compete in this expanding niche, which continues to bolster their prospects. We then applied our TSI Dividend Sustainability Rating System to a short list of income payers. It awards points to a stock based on key factors:\nOne point for five years of continuous dividend payments \u2013 two points for more than five;\ntwo points if it has raised the payment in the past five years;\none point for management\u2019s commitment to dividends;\none point for operating in non-cyclical industries;\none point for limited exposure to foreign currency rates and freedom from political interference;\ntwo points for a strong balance sheet, including manageable debt and adequate cash;\ntwo points for a long-term record of positive earnings and cash flow to cover dividends;\none point if the company\u2019s an industry leader.\nCompanies with 10 to 12 points have the most secure dividends, or the highest sustainability. Those with seven to nine points have above average sustainability; average sustainability, four to six points; and below average sustainability, one to three points.\nMore about TSI Network\nTSI Network is the online home of The Successful Investor Inc. \u2013 the group of widely followed Canadian investment newsletters by editor and publisher Pat McKeough.

            "description": "After exploding on to the scene as the next big thing in food, the plant-based meat trend has come back down to earth of late as consumers and investors learn there's not a lot of meat on the bones when it comes to sales growth \u2014 or profits.",
            "content": "After exploding on to the scene as the next big thing in food, the plant-based meat trend has come back down to earth of late as consumers and investors discover that, behind all the sizzle, there's not a lot of steak.\nThe poster child for the trend is Beyond Meat, the meat alternative company whose highly touted IPO in 2019 saw it more than double in value on its first day.\nThe business case was simple: For economic, environmental and health reasons, people around the world would soon decide to eat less meat, and instead consume plant-based proteins.\nBeyond Meat had developed a burger patty based on pea proteins that tasted like real meat, and it was flying off the shelves. Other products designed to mimic chicken and pork soon followed, and investors piled into a company that seemed well on its way to hundreds of billions of dollars in sales.\nBut it hasn't really worked out that way. According to analyst Jennifer Bartashus at Bloomberg Intelligence, after growing by 13 per cent in 2019 and almost 40 per cent in 2020, sales of meat alternatives at the five biggest North American producers slipped by four per cent last year.\nThat's a group of companies that includes Canada's Maple Leaf Foods, which jumped into the trend with both feet in 2019 when it committed $310 million to build a massive new factory in Indiana to produce meat alternatives.\nMeat prices are up by 10 per cent in the last year, but alternative proteins have been hit by the same inflationary forces. (LM Otero/The Associated Press)\nWhile the company's plant-based products that sell under the Lightlife, Field Roast and other brand names booked almost $45 million in sales in the first quarter of this year, they \"no longer expect spectacular category growth rates,\" it told investors in announcing financial results last month. \"We do see the plant category growing, but at a steady pace\" which is why the company plans to repurpose some of its plant-based factory space to making meat products again.\nThe company still thinks its plant-based meat business is on track to ring in up to $10 billion in sales within the decade. But that's less than half what it was anticipating before.\nIndustry-wide, the sales slowdown is partly caused by the same inflationary and supply chain problems that the entire food business is dealing with. And consumers are proving to be less willing to swallow higher prices.\nRising prices\nAnyone who has been into a grocery store recently knows that the price of food is going up quickly, and of meat in particular.\nStatistics Canada data showed that meat prices rose more than 10 per cent in the year up to April. But meat alternatives haven't been able to benefit from the growing consumer trend to save money on food because they're up sharply, too.\nSylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, calculated in a recent report that plant-based meat is, on average, 38 per cent more expensive at the retail level than its meat-based alternative.\nThe gap is widest for things like chicken nuggets and burger patties, but even comparatively cheaper items like bacon and hot dogs have a premium price attached to them for plant-based versions.\n\"With a very high inflation rate, a lot of people are looking for bargains. But if you're actually looking at plant-based products, that's not what you're getting,\" he said in an interview. \"These products may be good for the environment and good for your health, but they're certainly not good for your budget.\"\nDespite those cost considerations, Bloomberg's Bartashus still thinks there's lot of room for growth to come, and is forecasting sales for all plant-based meat products to grow from about $30 billion today, to almost $170 billion by 2031.\nThat would be about 10 per cent of what the world spends on protein every year, and a big reason for her optimism is the environmental argument.\n\"Concerns about sustainably feeding a growing population are driving interest in plant-based products that can serve as a replacement for conventional proteins,\" Bartashus said in a recent report to clients.\n\"We expect growth for plant-based meat and dairy alternatives will outpace conventional products, supported by innovation, increased production capacity, lower prices, broader distribution gains and consumer acceptance.\"\nOthers are not convinced that plant-based eating is anything more than a trendy food craze that may have run its course. \"Three years ago, we were seeing these large sales \u2026 to a very large number of consumers that were very curious and wanted to try it out,\" said Simon Somogyi, a professor who studies the food business at the University of Guelph. \"But the true marketplace is showing itself now.\"\nWhile vegetarianism is a steady and growing force in the food business, Somogyi says most people interested in plant-based eating are happy to eat more fruits and vegetables and conventional proteins like beans and lentils, as opposed to factory-made plant products that masquerade as meat.\n\"They were all the rage and consumers were curious to try them out, but now they've tried them and that fad has sort of worn off,\" he said.",

            "description": "\u2018Wild foods in general have lots of micronutrients that you don\u2019t get in any other foods, and the act of foraging and getting out there and living an active lifestyle is super healthy,\u2019 says chef Paul Moran",
            "content": "Foraging for plants like mushrooms and fiddlehead ferns is becoming a popular new hobby.Gabrielle Drolet\nThere\u2019s a word popping up all over the menus at the trendiest restaurants in town: \u201cwild.\u201d Wild mushrooms, wild leeks, wild fiddleheads, wild seaweed.\nPlants plucked straight from their natural habitats have made their way onto our plates, with many chefs and home cooks seeing their local woodlands, fields and bodies of water through a new, plentiful lens.\nWhy the sudden fondness for wild ingredients? \u201cI think basically people are paying more attention to what they\u2019re putting in their bodies,\u201d says Tofino-based chef Paul Moran, whose family has been foraging for five generations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift toward health and nutrition recently, and wild foods offer some of the best nutrition and health benefits. And more recently, with COVID-19, people have been spending more time outdoors, and that has a lot to do with it too.\u201d\nIn 2019, Moran impressed the judges on Top Chef Canada with, among other things, his stuffed foraged morels. In fact, he prepared them three times over the course of the show, which he went on to win.\nExpert forager Peter Blush leads groups in search of spring's hottest menu item, fiddleheads.Terry Manzo\nHe now shares his exceptional knowledge and cooking through Wild Origins, a company he founded that caters events and runs \u201cforage and feast adventures\u201d where he brings guests on foraging tours that end with a multi-course gourmet meal prepped by Moran incorporating the day\u2019s bounty.\n\u201cOur horizons have definitely broadened,\u201d he says. \u201cThere used to be, say, wild mushrooms on menus, but now some of the top restaurants are making sure they have wild plants and seaweeds on menus, which wasn\u2019t necessarily the case 15 or 20 years ago.\u201d Wild garlic, it seems, is 2022\u2032s answer to 2015\u2032s quinoa, or 2018\u2032s kefir.\nExpert forager Peter Blush is also appreciating the uptick in interest. Through his company, Puck\u2019s Plenty, in Stratford, Ont., he\u2019s been sharing his passion for the wild foods of Southwestern Ontario with both curious newbies and more seasoned foragers since 2010.\n'The act of foraging and getting out there and living an active lifestyle is super healthy,' says Moran.Peter Blush\n\u201cAll our events are sold out \u2013 I don\u2019t even advertise anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as culinary movements go, people are interested in the fact that \u2018Hey, right out there in the woods, we can go and harvest food that actually tastes really good.\u2019 They want something different when it comes to taste, and that can set them on the road to foraging.\u201d\nMany of Blush\u2019s guests really dig into foraging after a tour. \u201cA common comment I get is \u2018From now on, I\u2019ll never go into the forest and look at things like I used to,\u2019\u201d he says.\nOne of those converts is Mississauga-based architect Jenny Chau, who attended her first Puck\u2019s Plenty tour three years ago and has been keen on discovering the fruits of the forest ever since.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a connection to nature,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore, we would go on hikes and go, \u2018Oh, interesting plants,\u2019 but we weren\u2019t looking for [edible ones]. Now we go hiking and we look for mushrooms; we don\u2019t necessarily want to pick them because we\u2019re not knowledgeable enough yet, but it just makes your eyes more attuned to what\u2019s available.\u201d\nChau was long interested in learning about foraging but was wary about going out on her own and picking something inedible. (\u201cIt\u2019s not a pleasant ride through your digestive tract,\u201d Blush says drily of eating the wrong plants.) But now that she\u2019s had a solid intro, she\u2019s building up to foraging independently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very relaxing. You don\u2019t rush \u2013 you just have to observe [and determine] what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. And when you pick some things, you feel very accomplished,\u201d she adds.\nTop Chef Canada winner Paul Moran is a fifth generation forager who now uses his expertise to guide groups in search of wild ingredients.Dominic Hall\nBoth Blush and Moran encourage anyone who\u2019s interested to join foraging groups on social media or go out with a knowledgeable guide the first couple of times. \u201cKnowing what to forage and how to forage is really important,\u201d say Blush. \u201cYou have to know what\u2019s poisonous and what\u2019s not. For example, wild leeks and lily of the valley look similar, but lily of the valley is poisonous.\u201d\nBlush stresses that the most important consideration is sustainability: knowing how to pick things without depleting the growth in that area. \u201cWild leeks grow in beds, and if you take the entire bed, they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d he says by way of example. \u201cSo you don\u2019t take a lot and you take from the middle of the bed because you want it to keep expanding.\u201d\nUltimately, foraging isn\u2019t going to go very far in supplementing people\u2019s diets \u2013 but it\u2019s a good exercise in learning about our natural environment and an opportunity to enjoy wild foods. \u201cThey\u2019re a nice accompaniment for people to incorporate into their diet from time to time or when they\u2019re in season,\u201d says Moran. Foraged foods are also a way for people to eat more sustainably, a \u201chyper local\u201d menu with no guilt-inducing carbon footprint (unless, of course, you drove to that patch in the woods \u2013 and even then, that\u2019s nothing on the refrigerated miles logged by most other produce).\n\u201cWild foods in general have lots of micronutrients that you don\u2019t get in any other foods, and the act of foraging and getting out there and living an active lifestyle is super healthy,\u201d says Moran.\nA trend we can all go wild for.\nSign up for The Globe\u2019s arts and lifestyle newsletters for more news, columns and advice in your inbox.",

The various factors could lead 6 million Somalis into acute food crisis, the UN said.\n\u201cToday, if more is not done to support rural communities, the scale of the devastation in terms of hunger and lost livelihoods will be appalling,\u201d the UN said. \u201cUrgent humanitarian action is needed on a massive scale to prevent that from happening.\u201d\nThe war in Ukraine poses further risks for Somalia and many other African countries that reply on Ukraine and Russia for wheat, fertilizer and other food supplies.\nThe United Nations previously said the war was helping to send prices for commodities such as grains and vegetable oils to record highs, threatening millions with hunger and malnourishment.\n\u201cWhen we look at the consequences of what\u2019s happening as a result of the war in Ukraine, there is real cause for concern of how this will amplify the acute food needs that exist in these food crisis countries,\u201d said Rein Paulsen, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s office of emergencies and resilience.\nThe report called for greater investment in agriculture and appealed for $1.5 billion to help farmers in at-risk regions with the upcoming planting season to help stabilize and increase local food production.\nOur Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.

Try refreshing your browser, or Karen Gordon: Sushi bake, despite the name, is nothing like real sushi Back to video I\u2019m no sushi connoisseur but I\u2019ve certainly eaten my fair share of it. I can attest that sushi bake is unlike any sushi you\u2019ve ever eaten. It\u2019s a novel concept with origins in the Philippines and Hawaii. While it has the word sushi in it, it\u2019s really nothing like real sushi. In other words, it contains no raw fish and it\u2019s not even rolled. While it has the trappings of sushi, like rice and nori \u2014 Japanese dried seaweed \u2014 that\u2019s where the similarities end. Sushi bake is served warm, in a casserole dish, family style. It\u2019s a deconstructed sushi roll served on top of Nori. It\u2019s a layer of deliciously seasoned sushi rice, creamy and cheesy crabmeat, topped with a generous drizzle of Japanese kewpie mayo, unagi sauce and then baked until slightly caramelized. It\u2019s then cut into 1-1/2\u201d by 3\u201d size pieces or scooped with a spoon onto pieces of nori, folded up and eaten like a Mexican taco. It\u2019s great for those who find eating raw fish a little intimidating.\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content And for those who love their California rolls, then this is the dish for you. The rice is warm, sticky, and slightly tangy, while the filling is rich, creamy and decadent. The combination is simply delicious! There are many ways of making sushi bakes. In its most basic form, it consists of a layer of sushi rice topped with a creamy mixture of imitation crabmeat, Japanese kewpie mayo, cream cheese and then baked until warm and slightly caramelized. However, other ingredients like cooked flaked salmon, crabmeat, tobiko also known as flying fish roe, avocado, green onions, unagi (eel sauce) and sriracha may also be added to add another layer of deliciousness to the dish. Here are a few tips for making a knockout sushi bake:\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u2022 Use Japanese short-grain sushi rice. It\u2019s stickier than white rice and is used specifically for sushi making. It\u2019s sticky with a chewy bite. \u2022 Use a good, seasoned rice vinegar. My personal favourite is Marukan Seasoned Gourmet Rice Vinegar available in the Asian section of supermarkets. \u2022 Wash the rice well before cooking. This helps get rid of excess starch and prevents gumminess. \u2022 Add the vinegar mixture to the rice when the rice is hot. This will help the rice to absorb the flavour of the vinegar and give it that deliciously tangy flavour. \u2022 Use butter to grease the baking dish to prevent sticking. While you can use olive oil, butter adds additional flavour and another level of richness to the dish. \u2022 Cool the rice before compressing it in the casserole pan. Cooled rice will hold its shape, reducing the chance of the sushi bake falling apart when removing it from the pan.\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u2022 Use Kewpie Japanese-style mayonnaise. Unlike regular mayo, Kewpie mayo is thicker and richer tasting. It\u2019s also a little sweeter and tangier which adds another level of complexity to the dish. \u2022 Don\u2019t skip the Furikake. Furikake (pronounced as foo-ree-kar-kay) is a Japanese condiment that adds a briny, umami taste to the sushi bake. It simply won\u2019t be the same without it! Photo by Karen Gordon / PNG California Style Sushi Bake Sushi Rice: 2 cups raw sushi rice 3 cups cold water 3 tbsp seasoned rice wine vinegar 1/8 tsp salt 1 tsp granulated sugar Filling: 1 lb. (480g) imitation crabmeat, chopped 1 block (250g) cream cheese, softened to room temperature 1/2 cup Kewpie mayo 1 tbsp sriracha sauce, more or less to taste 1/2 tsp sesame oil 1/8 cup tobiko, raw flying fish roe\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Topping: Furikake Kewpie Mayo Unagi Sauce Roasted seaweed flakes (optional) Green onions, chopped Dried nori seaweed sheets or roasted seaweed packets Soy sauce (optional) Instructions: Rinse rice very well under cold running water. Once the water runs clear, drain, and add 3 cups of cold water. Cook rice in a rice-cooker until done. In a separate bowl, add the seasoned rice wine vinegar, salt, and granulated sugar. Whisk until the salt and sugar is dissolved. Once the rice is done, fluff the rice lightly, immediately add the seasoned vinegar to the hot rice. Continue mixing gently. Do not mush up the rice. Once the grains are well seasoned, set the rice aside to cool. While rice is cooling, prepare the filling.\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content In a medium size mixing bowl, add the cream cheese. Using a wooden spoon, mash up the cream cheese and stir until smooth. Add the mayo, sriracha, and sesame oil. Stir to combine. Add the chopped imitation crabmeat and tobiko. Stir well to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter a 9\u00d713\u201d casserole dish. Add the cooled seasoned rice. Using the back of a wooden spoon, compress the rice into the pan, creating an even layer. Sprinkle Furikake over the rice then top with the imitation crab mixture. Using the back of a spoon, spread the crab mixture evenly over the rice. Drizzle kewpie mayo in a diagonal pattern over the crab mixture. Then drizzle sriracha in the opposite direction, creating a cross-hatch pattern. Sprinkle roasted seaweed flakes, if using. Bake for approximately 15 minutes until the top is caramelized and bubbly. Remove from the oven and garnish with chopped green onions. Using a knife, slice the sushi bake into pieces measuring 1-1/2\u201d wide by 3\u201d long. Then use a spatula to lift and remove the sushi bake from the pan. To serve, place sushi bake on top of a piece of seaweed. Dip in soy sauce, if using, before eating. Enjoy!

            "content": "* reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=INCPIY%3DECI poll data\n* Data due at 1200 GMT, Sept 12\nBy Arsh Tushar Mogre and Anant Chandak\nBENGALURU, Sept 9 (Reuters) - India's retail inflation likely snapped a three-month downward trend in August as food prices surged, a Reuters poll of economists found, which may add pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to hike interest rates more aggressively in coming months.\nFood inflation, which accounts for nearly half the consumer price index (CPI) basket, is expected to have soared as prices of essential crops like wheat, rice and pulses were driven higher by a record heatwave, squeezing household budgets.\nWhile high inflation is a global phenomenon, it is felt acutely in a country like India where millions live in abject poverty.\nDespite the Indian government restricting wheat flour exports towards the end of last month, inflation - as measured by the CPI - likely rose to an annual 6.90% in August, compared with 6.71% in the prior month, the Sept. 5-8 Reuters poll of about 45 economists showed.\nForecasts for the data, due for release at 1200 GMT on Sept. 12, ranged between 6.30% and 7.37%, with over a quarter of forecasters expecting 7.0% or above.\n\"Food prices have actually gone up for major cereals, pulses and vegetables on an annual basis because of the production challenges and shortfalls caused by a blistering heatwave,\" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale.\nHe also said erratic monsoon patterns across the country suggest there would be more crop damages, keeping food prices elevated in coming months.\nThe RBI's own projections showed inflation staying above the 6% top end of its target range until early 2023.\nThe central bank was expected to hike the repo rate by another 60 basis points through the end of March to 6.00% from a pandemic-era record low 4.00%, a separate Reuters poll showed.\nInterest rates are rising even as the economy is expected to slow sharply. At the same time, the RBI is spending billions of dollars a month in currency reserves to defend the weak rupee, which has been trading near record lows of around 80 per dollar for several months.\n(Reporting by Arsh Tushar Mogre and Anant Chandak, Polling and analysis by Devayani Sathyan; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n\u00a9 Copyright Thomson Reuters 2022.

            "content": "Just like the monsoon season in India and the dry season along the tropical rain belt, there is another yearly weather pattern we here at the TODAY Food trend forecasting center watch out for: pumpkin spice season. We're sorry to be the ones to tell you this, but our radar has detected the big one \u2014 it\u2019s coming.\nOn Tuesday, Starbucks will once again become the origin point of the inescapable sweater tsunami that is autumn with its signature Pumpkin Spice Latte.\nDue to Hurricane PSL coming out Tuesday, there is a 100% probability that someone wearing an infinity scarf, well-worn Uggs and a chunky knit sweater will post a selfie with their their head tilted back, sticking their tongue out with a peace sign with one hand and holding that sweet spiced nectar in the other. Oh, the humanity.\nStay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC10 Boston app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.\nThis is the 19th year of PSL season, being first tracked as a phenomenon-in-the-making in 2003, and the rest is cheugy history, as they say.\nStorm trackers say the air will smell of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, spices that Starbucks says complements the real pumpkin in the sauce. Yes, there really is pumpkin in it, running contrary to prior speculations from one beloved TODAY weatherman.\nAccording to CNN, a stronger storm \u2014 inflation \u2014 has affected the price of the PSL as well. The cyclone of sweet spices will now be about 4% higher in cost compared to 2021. This has upped the price of a PSL to between $5.45 to as much as $5.95, depending on location.\nStarbucks also said its Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew is returning to the menu for its fourth year. This drink consists of cold brew sweetened with vanilla syrup, topped with pumpkin cream cold foam and a dusting of pumpkin spice, and may be ideal for those that need the energy boost to outrun the throngs of PS-lovers wearing skinny jeans with upper-calf length Tory Burch booties on their way to film a TikTok of a leaf-strewn picnic near the train tracks.\nAlso coming back for its second year is the Starbucks Apple Crisp Macchiato, but t'is now made with oat milk and Starbucks Blonde Espresso. This makes it the brand\u2019s first official no-dairy fall offering.\nThe beverage is inspired by the flavors of an apple crisp with a cup of coffee, much like two weather fronts combining to create something altogether new in the atmosphere. The Starbucks creation layers the flavors of apple, cinnamon and brown sugar topped with a spiced apple drizzle, much like a colorful heap of freshly-raked leaves, but a lot tastier, we imagine.\nAlso coming back this season are fall-flavored baked goods, like the coffee giant's Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin and Pumpkin Scone which are both available for a limited time in addition to the available-year-round Pumpkin Loaf. One new item is an Owl Cake Pop that combines vanilla cake and buttercream which is then dipped in purple chocolatey icing and festooned with the face of a cute little owl.\nYou can also expect on the forecast new and returning Starbucks coffee and creamers at your local grocer's while supplies last, including a new canned Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew Pumpkin Cream coffee concentrate and a Salted Caramel Mocha-flavored roast as well as ground coffee.\nPrepare your feeds for the onslaught of ecru, beige and eggshell, neutral suedes and sparkly reusable tumblers at a magnitude between \u201csweater weather\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me until I\u2019ve had my java.\u201d These competing weather systems will occur within a 20 mile radius around any Starbucks location during the next few months. That basically means, like, everywhere in the country, so plan to take cover.\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com. More from TODAY:",

            "description": "People are going crazy online over a new make up technique which takes 'the natural look' to a whole different level.",
            "content": "TikTok has given us many beauty trends over the six years, peanut butter nails, nose shrinking, and the trick of pouring your foundation in a glass of water for extra hydration.\nWith many people making an effort to live in a more sustainable way lately, is it any wonder that the trend of using fruit as make up has hit it off on TikTok, with over 24 million views on the hashtag? The challenge was reportedly started by Ukrainian user @molchanovamua, who originally suggested using fruit in this way to create a 100% natural look.\nThe trend has been picked up and trialed by many users and beauty influencers alike, with make up aficionado Gabrille Alexis trying it out with over 19 million views entitled, \"I'm impressed\".\nIn the video, Gabrielle can be seen brandishing a banana, a cherry and a blackberry, applying them to her face instead of makeup. She chars the stalk of the banana to achieve a smoky eye look and lip liner, bites the cherry in half and applies blush and eyeshadow, and uses the blackberry as lip tint.\nThe results? A subtle, natural look, without the chemicals or price tag.\nThe Fruit Challenge\nThis innovative way of getting your five a day has delighted users online due to it's sustainability, but also the fact that it does seem to actually work.\nWebsite One Green Planet who describe themselves as, \"your online guide to making conscious and compassionate choices that help people, animals and the planet\", also advocate incorporating fruit in to your beauty regime.\n\"While many brands advertise themselves as being 'natural' or even 'organic', the truth is, many of these labels are false in terms of their truly natural ingredient list and seemingly healthy profile,\" explains the site, \"Then there's the reaction to the chemicals in beauty products many people face. Eyes watering, rashes, dry skin, sneezing, oily breakouts \u2014 these might all be a reaction to a product you are using and can even lead to swelling, hives, and even headaches if you're highly chemical-sensitive.\"\nThey also suggest blackberries, recommending using fresh fruit, or lightly thawing a frozen one and rubbing it on your lips as a natural stain, \"It also won't dry your lips out and as a bonus, adds a nice dose of antioxidants directly to your skin!\"\nEqually a fresh or frozen cherry can make a great blush alternative, \". To make a blush with cherries, use a couple of frozen cherries and let them thaw. Then, dab your index and middle finger of your predominant hand in the juice, and dip just slightly enough to get some color on them. Dab on your cheeks and rub in a circular motion, just enough to add a touch of color. If you get too much, don't worry; it dabs right off, but will also naturally set in your skin after a few seconds so you won't have to worry about it rubbing off later.\"\nThe technique of charring a banana stem to create eyeliner is arguably no different to a charcoal pen, and could easily work with other fruit stems like apples and pears if banana isn't your favorite. But, be sure to make certain that the heat has completely subsided before you apply it to your face!\nOther fruit stems \u2013 apple, pear \u2013 but be sure to put it out though roughly first and don't burn yourself!\nFairy Makeup\nThe technique delighted users online, with one person commenting, \"This is how fairies do it\", with over 70 thousand likes. One user said, \"The cherry tint is key\", while another wrote, \"The cherry worked beautifully\".\nSome people were concerned that applying fresh fruit on their faces would result in a sticky mess, \"Imagine how sticky that would get\", said one user while another commented, \"Waiting on the wasps be like...\".",

            "description": "We tried out the unusual TikTok trend that was started by food influencer Allyssa Marshall and has received rave reviews online.",
            "content": "From frozen honey, to watermelon with mustard and pasta chips, recent years have seen their fair share of bizarre food trends circulating online.\nAnd the latest viral fad seems just as unusual as its predecessors. Spicy ros\u00e9 is simply a glass of ros\u00e9 wine infused with sliced jalape\u00f1o and as strange as the trend may seem, the drink has had rave reviews online.\nThe craze was started by Allyssa Marshall, who has racked up nearly 400,000 followers on her 'Allyssa in the Kitchen' TikTok and Instagram accounts combined, when she was dared by a follower to drop a pepper into her wine.\nSince then, the impromptu cocktail has blown up on social media, with the hashtag #jalepenoros\u00e9 racking up a whopping 69,8000 views on TikTok.\nAllyssa told Newsweek: \"I have always been a home cook and loved being in the kitchen. Cooking dinner with a glass of wine and good tunes will always be my happy place. I began posting my recipes on TikTok in 2021 and have never looked back!\n\"So, where did the jalape\u00f1o ros\u00e9 come from? The idea came from my love for spicy margaritas, and a running joke amongst my followers that I am obsessed with jalape\u00f1o and add them to everything.\n\"I was on a live stream one night drinking ros\u00e9 and a follower dared me to add some jalape\u00f1o slices to my glass, and the rest is history...What started as a fun and random idea has now turned into the only way myself, and anyone who tries it, can drink ros\u00e9.\n\"My reaction to this going viral? Honestly not too surprising because as soon as I took my first sip I knew it was a slam dunk and others would love it too. I love seeing this idea grow and reach so many people! If my ros\u00e9 isn't spicy, then I don't want it!\"\nDespite hearing Allyssa's high praise for the drink, I have to admit I was dubious to try out this trend. As someone who has definitely fallen into TikTok traps before, and been bitterly disappointed, I really wasn't expecting too much.\nUsing the French Baron Gassier Provence St V Rose, I decided to use about half of the jalape\u00f1o and waited for around thirty minutes so the flavors could infuse slightly before I gave the drink a try. After a little while, the smell of the wine changed totally and I was very worried the wine would be massively overpowered by the pepper.\nI wasn't sure what I thought about the combo on my first taste, it definitely wasn't what I expected and wasn't spicy, as I assumed it would be. It actually has quite an earthy taste and the heat of the pepper really balances out the sharp citrusy tones of the ros\u00e9.\nAs I drank more I could feel a bit more heat, though it definitely wasn't spicy and almost had a bit of a smoky flavor. After a few sips, I really started to enjoy the taste and would definitely consider doing this on a regular basis.\nI think this is a great summer drink which reminds me of a spicy margarita, and will definitely be an addition to any future BBQs this year.",

According to Texas Monthly, Helen Corbitt, a former head chef for Neiman Marcus, created the dish when instructed to use only Texas-based ingredients.\nOver 80 years later, TikTokers are creating their own versions by substituting or adding certain in-season foods, taking the app by a storm and inspiring a whole new generation of people to try the recipe themselves. Even getting celebrities like Shay Mitchell inspired to give it a go.\nLeading the way in the cowboy caviar resurgence is TikToker Bria Lemirande, whose versions of the popular dip have amassed 12.5 million views, inspiring others to embrace the southern-inspired dish.\nThe trend is taking TikTok by storm. TikTok/@stassiebaby\nDifferent versions of the recipe are popping up with users putting their own twist on the dish. TikTok/@ brialem\nThe dish gets its name due to its resemblance to caviar. TikTok/ @brialem\nThe classic version of cowboy caviar contains black-eyed peas, tomatoes, bell peppers and onion dressed in a vinaigrette, but newer recipes tend to include more legumes, fruits and even cheese.\n@brialem I made cowboy caviar once again ( I added peaches this time!) \u266c original sound \u2013 bria lemirande\nBria Lemirande\u2019s Cowboy Caviar:\n1 red bell pepper\n1 orange bell pepper\n1 yellow bell pepper\n1 green bell pepper\n2 jalapenos\n3/4 red onion\n1 mango\n2 cups sweet corn\n1 container feta cheese\n1 can sliced black olives\n2 cans black beans, rinsed\n1 can pinto beans, rinsed\n2 avocados\nDressing:\nJuice of 3 limes\n1/2 cup olive oil\n1/4 cup white wine vinegar\n3-4 tablespoons taco seasoning\n2-4 tablespoons spicy honey\n3 tablespoons sugar, or to taste\nSalt and pepper to taste\nOptional: Taco seasoning\nFinely dice all ingredients then add in the dressing.

            "content": "As a trained chef, cookbook author and, most notably, host of Food Network\u2019s entertaining Good Eats, Alton Brown has seen just about every food fad come and go.\nBut there\u2019s one culinary rage that Brown recently confessed he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the back of, and soon.\nAlton Brown | Jude Domski/WireImage\nAlton Brown recently announced he\u2019s split from Food Network\nThe chef revealed to Entertainment Weekly that he and Food Network have parted ways, emphasizing that he had to make the move to stay close to Iron Chef, which will now stream on Netflix.\n\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think goodbye,\u201d he said. \u201cGoodbye is really final. Perhaps au revoir or adieu for now. I don\u2019t really think of myself as having left a place as much as I simply crossed the street to join one of my first loves. I had 20 pretty spectacular years at Food Network. I built a brand there. I became part of Iron Chef America there.\n\u201cTo be honest, if Netflix had taken a shot at Iron Chef without me, that would have broken my heart,\u201d Brown added. \u201cSo I had to follow that franchise, which has been such a big part of my life and a really big part of my career. And as it evolves into something new and spectacular, I just had to be a part of it.\u201d\nAlton Brown hosts \u2018Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend\u2019 with Kristen Kish in June 2022 on Netflix.\nBrown opened up about the food trend he\u2019s beyond done with\nThe Good Eats star took part in a post-Q&A session after an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Holding a stack of cards with questions from curious fans, Brown handled topics from whether culinary school is really necessary (\u201cNo, but it would help if you would buy a full set of all the books that I\u2019ve written\u201d) to the best crust for peach pie (Short answer: traditional pie crust).\nAsked, \u201cWhat is the one food you think you should want but you don\u2019t?,\u201d Brown answered with an expression close to disgust on his face: \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see another piece of avocado toast. I would rather eat a rotten cat spread out on bread than put another piece of avocado toast in my mouth. I\u2019ve had it.\u201d\nHe added, as only Alton Brown could, \u201cBy the way, did you know avocados are one of the only fruits that will not ripen until picked? Just thought you should know that,\u201d adding jokingly, \u201cBut don\u2019t you put it on toast or I\u2019ll come for you!\u201d\nAlthough the chef is tired of avocado toast, his spin on it sounds pretty good\nBack in the days when the now-former Food Network star still liked avocado toast, he made quite a delicious version of the dish.\nBrown\u2019s twist on the toast features canned sardines with a kick of sherry vinegar.\nBasically, toasted bread is topped with sardines marinated in a mixture of parsley, sherry vinegar, lemon zest, black pepper and, of course, smashed avocado.\nYou can find the full recipe on Food Network\u2019s site. Just don\u2019t tell Alton Brown.\nRELATED: Alton Brown\u2019s 3-Ingredient \u2018Burger of the Gods\u2019 Is the Ultimate Juicy Burger Recipe",

            "description": "Find out why Food Network star and no-nonsense chef Alton Brown doesn't like food trends and why he'll make an exception for one.",
            "content": "Food Network has brought viewers many stars throughout the years. However, none seems as down-to-earth as Alton Brown. The popular host has explored all kinds of cuisine in the dozens of Food Network shows he\u2019s appeared on, but he still takes the time to interact with fans.\nIn 2019, Brown took to Reddit to field questions from users in an AMA (ask me anything) session. Brown was happy to give fans all kinds of cooking advice. One of the most surprising things the celebrity chef admitted was that he\u2019s not into food trends. However, he said he\u2019d make an exception for one.\nThe food trend Alton Brown doesn\u2019t mind\nAlton Brown | Brad Barket/Getty Images\nFood trends come and go. Usually, they bring new kinds of food to the forefront of American culture. Quinoa had its day, as did kale. But Alton Brown didn\u2019t buy into any of them.\nHe uses the ingredients that are best when they\u2019re best, not because of a trend. But there\u2019s one trend Brown doesn\u2019t mind so much.\nAccording to his Reddit AMA, Brown is OK with the plant-based food trend. The recent explosion of vegetarianism and veganism in the general public has led to a new appreciation for vegetarian food.\nIt\u2019s no longer qualified as \u201cvegetarian.\u201d Now, plant-based food has earned its spot alongside meat-based meals.\n\u201cI generally just hate trends,\u201d Brown wrote, \u201cbut if I had to pick one, it\u2019s probably the slow acceptance of vegetarian food as just \u2026 good rather than \u2018vegetarian.'\u201d\nMajor celebrities have promoted the plant-based trend\nIt\u2019s no wonder the plant-based movement has redefined vegetarian food. The fad came with some serious star power behind it. Many celebrities in recent years have announced they\u2019re plant-based or primarily plant-based.\nFor instance, Lizzo loves vegan food. And Beyonc\u00e9 goes plant-based when preparing for a show or big event.\nIn addition, Zendaya is a full-time vegetarian. Also, Brad Pitt is an outspoken vegan and claims he chose a plant-based lifestyle for environmental reasons. Kristen Bell has been a vegetarian her entire life and recently went vegan.\nImitation meats that taste like the real thing have greatly helped the plant-based movement. Companies like Beyond Meat have made even fast-food burgers a possibility for plant-based eaters. In fact, Jessica Chastain invested in Beyond Meat. She\u2019s a vegan and wanted to give others the chance to go vegan without missing out on a good burger.\nAlton Brown doesn\u2019t want to make cooking good food complicated\nThough Alton Brown is known for his deep knowledge of food, that doesn\u2019t mean he thinks it has to be complicated. Plant-based celebs may have access to personal chefs and pricey restaurants, but Brown believes anyone can cook a good meal.\nDuring his Reddit AMA, the Food Network celebrity advised fans to invest in a few good knives and get a good cutting board.\nBrown said that when it\u2019s time to cook, he starts by opening the refrigerator. He told Redditors that cooking a good meal sometimes means working with what you have on hand. His go-to meal? \u201cRoast chicken \u2026 AND WAFFLES.\u201d\nThe point is, despite Brown\u2019s culinary success, he\u2019s still a down-to-earth guy. He makes down-to-earth food. That food may or may not have meat or dairy in it. But it\u2019s still good.\nRELATED: Why Alton Brown Cooks Meatballs in an Egg Carton",

            "content": "The food delivery business, and tech companies leading the charge, were hot commodities at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic as people stayed indoors and turned to apps to fill their bellies with pre-made meals. Now with that trend cooling off, those companies are feeling the chill.\nIn the latest development, big changes and drama continue to buffet Just Eat Takeaway, one of its big players in the global food delivery business. The company today said that its chairman, Adriaan N\u00fchn, is leaving the company effective today as the company pushes to refocus itself; and that its COO, J\u00f6rg Gerbig, has also stepped away from his role on the management board because he is being investigated for inappropriate behavior \u2014 in the company\u2019s words, \u201cpossible personal misconduct.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway also confirmed to TechCrunch that it is still exploring divestment options for Grubhub, the U.S. business it paid $7.3 billion to acquire less than a year ago, in June 2021.\n\u201cIn April we confirmed that management is currently, together with its advisers, actively exploring the introduction of a strategic partnership and/or the sale of Grubhub, in whole or in part,\u201d a spokesperson today told TechCrunch. \u201cThe process is ongoing and further announcements will be made as and when appropriate. There can be no certainty that any such strategic actions will be agreed or what the timing of such agreements will be.\u201d\nJust Eat Takeaway announced the two executive changes just ahead of its annual general meeting, where both had been scheduled to be reappointed to their roles.\nWhile the two executive announcements are unrelated to each other, together they contribute to a picture of a company facing a wide set of challenges at the moment.\nPartly because the business is under pressure, Just Eat Takeaway was clear to spell out that Gerbig\u2019s investigation was \u201cnot related to financial or reporting obligations\u201d but the result of a confidential complaint through the company\u2019s Speak Up program where employees can report misconduct allegations.\nN\u00fchn\u2019s departure is, however, directly related to the changing tides of the business and shareholder dissatisfaction with how it\u2019s being managed.\n\u201cThe Chairman\u2019s decision to stand down recognises the concerns raised by our shareholders,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cTheir strong support is important to ensure the Company can focus on the challenges and opportunities ahead. We understand and share the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders. We are working hard to address them with proposed actions that management is confident will position Just Eat Takeaway.com for continued success going forward.\u201d\nThe bigger picture for Just Eat Takeaway is that demand in the food delivery business has been wilting, and the rush of startups that raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build their businesses around it, went public on the back of early growth, and then danced when business boomed during the pandemic, are all now feeling the pain.\nJust Eat Takeaway is listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange, and its share price has been dropping over the last six months: at the moment it is around \u20ac25/share, close to the lower end of its 52-week range (which is \u20ac23.59 \u2013 83.56), and well below the company\u2019s price when it originally listed. That pressure had already prompted CEO Jitse Groen last month to disclose that the company was eyeing up a plan to either partly divest or entirely sell off its Grubhub business in the U.S.\nIt is not the only company seeing cooling demand. Transportation giant Uber, which owns Uber Eats, this morning reported its Q1 earnings, where it said that its mobility business (e-hailing of cars and its other ride-based operations) just pipped its delivery business (which includes Uber Eats), at $2.52 billion versus $2.51 billion respectively.\nGross bookings for delivery at Uber are still exceeding those of mobility, at $13.9 billion versus $10.7 billion respectively, but the growth of the segments tells a different story. Mobility\u2019s bookings were up 58% over a year ago as more people get comfortable again with less social distancing; while delivery was up only 12%.\nJust Eat Takeaway and Uber Eats are not alone. DoorDash is due to report its quarterly earnings tomorrow, and those will be coming at a time when it\u2019s also seeing lukewarm interest in its stock. DoorDash too has been trading down over the last six months, and its share price as of this writing, at just under $80/share, is also at the low end of its 52-week range ($74.32 \u2013 257.25).\nAnd the picture seems just as challenging in Europe. Deliveroo, which went public in London just over a year ago, is also trading down, and is currently at just over \u00a3107/share, also at the low end of its 52-week range (\u00a399.04 \u2013 396.80). Its Q1 earnings, posted in April, showed gross transaction value that, like Uber Eats, grew 12% \u2014 a very far cry from the 133% growth in the same period a year ago.\nFor Just Eat Takeaway, the executive departures and the news of the Grubhub sale are also a stark contrast compared to the heyday of Covid-19 business. Two years ago \u2014 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 the company quietly negotiated to buy Grubhub from under the nose of Uber, which itself was also looking to acquire Grubhub as part of a bigger economy of scale play. Uber later picked up Postmates for significantly less money, $2.65 billion all in stock, to fill out its consolidation ambitions.\nNow, who knows what the coming months will now bring for any of them in terms of consumer demand, whether they will follow through on their promise of making everything more efficient through tech, and, because they are all publicly listed, whether investors keep an appetite as they work through these things.",

            "content": "Her family announced her death, which came just weeks before publication of her memoir and cookbook, \u201cSix California Kitchens: A Collection of Recipes, Stories, and Cooking Lessons From a Pioneer of California Cuisine.\u201d\nSally Schmitt, who with her husband, Don, opened the French Laundry, the now famous restaurant in the Napa Valley of California, in 1978, and in doing so helped solidify the valley as a food-and-wine destination and start a culinary movement built on seasonal local ingredients, died Saturday at her home in Philo, California. She was 90.\nA photo via the Schmitt family of Sally Schmitt at the French Laundry in the late 1970s, shortly after it opened.\nToday the French Laundry, in Yountville, California, is renowned as the flagship establishment of chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller and turns up routinely on lists of the best restaurants in the country and the world. But as Keller, who bought the restaurant from the Schmitts in 1994, is always quick to point out, the Schmitts, and especially Sally Schmitt\u2019s cooking, started it all.\nGet Fast Forward A look at the news and events shaping the day, delivered a couple times a week with a side of humor and a dash of attitude. Enter Email Sign Up\n\u201cKind and generous, forthright, and unpretentious,\u201d he wrote in the foreword to her forthcoming book. \u201cA culinary pioneer but also a throwback, preparing dishes that evoked the most delicious versions of your favorite childhood meals. That is the Sally we all came to know.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Schmitts arrived in Yountville, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, in 1967 to manage a shopping arcade, and soon Sally had taken over a hamburger-and-sandwich place there. Four years later she opened the more ambitious Chutney Kitchen, which served lunch and, once a month by reservation only, dinner. Soon the dinners were twice a month, and she added theme dinners and more.\nThe couple had noticed a local stone building that had once been a French steam laundry (as well as a bar and a boardinghouse), and when it came up for sale they bought it.\n\u201cThe building was so crude, so clearly humble,\u201d Sally Schmitt told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1993. \u201cThere was not one good piece of hardware or woodwork or molding to keep. There wasn\u2019t \u2014 there isn\u2019t \u2014 a single straight line in the whole building.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe restaurant they opened there in February 1978 also had its own personality. With Don Schmitt curating an extensive wine menu, Sally Schmitt planned and prepared the meals, one menu each night, built around what was in season locally and in supply. Guests had their table for the evening; they were welcome to linger for three or four hours if they chose.\nThe area was already known for wine, but the French Laundry and a few other restaurants helped make it a foodie destination as well. By 1980 Sally Schmitt was noticing a change.\n\u201cWe now get people up here from San Francisco for dinner,\u201d she told The Napa Valley Register that year, \u201cwhere the reverse has generally been true.\u201d\nMs. Schmitt was not a culinary-school diva; she often said that her influences were her mother, an aunt and a home economics teacher she had in high school.\n\u201cSome things can\u2019t be improved upon, because they\u2019re so basic and so real,\u201d she told The Chronicle. \u201cI resist the trendy stuff. Sometimes even if I like something, I won\u2019t do it until it cools off somewhat.\u201d\nWith her emphasis on locally sourced ingredients, Ms. Schmitt is viewed as a pioneer in what was eventually known as California cuisine, but she didn\u2019t think of herself in those terms. \u201cFrench country cooking is what I lean to,\u201d she said in the 1993 interview, \u201cthe braised meats, simple things, lots of vegetables, homey desserts rather than pastry-cart desserts.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHer kitchens tended toward low-tech.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always tried to keep it simple,\u201d she wrote in the new book, \u201cwhich is why I\u2019ve never felt the need to use a food processor or microwave. Instead, I\u2019ve had good sharp knives, pots and pans, a big chopping block, a wooden spoon and a whisk. I\u2019ve always loved to work with my hands. It\u2019s what cooking is all about.\u201d\nHer cuisine, she said, wasn\u2019t about taking a philosophical stand.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a mission,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times in 2020. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to prove anything to the world about simple, fresh, local food. It was just the way I cooked. I didn\u2019t really have a statement to make. I just put food on the table.\u201d\nSarah Elizabeth Kelsoe (who was always known as Sally) was born Feb. 28, 1932, in Roseville, California, near Sacramento. Her father, Henry, worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, and her mother, Helen, was a homemaker and schoolteacher.\nShe grew up in the Sacramento Valley, where her family had enough land to grow vegetables and keep a cow; as a child she churned butter and learned canning. And kitchen techniques.\n\u201cAs soon as I was ready, my mother put a paring knife in my hand, and I peeled potatoes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd when she thought I was ready for a larger knife, I was cutting vegetables by her side.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nShe studied home economics at the University of California, Davis, though she transferred to the university\u2019s Berkeley campus for her final year, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1952.\nShe married Donald Schmitt in 1953. Her first cooking, she said, was done for their family, which eventually grew to five children.\n\u201cEven though I loved cooking, I never thought about going into the food world,\u201d she wrote of that time. \u201cThere were no women chefs in those days. Plus, cooks were looked down upon in those days; there was no such thing as a celebrity chef.\u201d\nAfter the Schmitts sold the French Laundry, they joined their daughter Karen Bates and her husband, Tim, at the Apple Farm in Philo, where Sally Schmitt would teach cooking classes.\nMs. Schmitt\u2019s husband died in 2017. She is survived by two sons, Johnny and Eric; three daughters, Kathy Hoffman, Bates and Terry Schmitt; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.\nA number of those descendants logged time working at the French Laundry, and some went on to their own culinary careers, including her grandson Perry Hoffman, now a chef at the Boonville Hotel and Restaurant in Northern California. In a telephone interview, he recalled doing various chores from a young age in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen \u2014 roasting peppers, peeling onions and more.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how special it was until much later,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just so good at everything she did. It was so simple but so complex.\u201d",

            "content": "People choose certain foods or change their diets for a range of reasons: to improve their health, lose weight, save money or due to concerns about sustainability or the way food is produced.\nConsider the trend towards low-fat products in the 1980s and low-carb diets in the 1990s, and now, the rise in plant-based protein products and ready-to-eat meals.\nBut before you abandon your traditional food choices, it\u2019s important to consider the nutritional trade-offs. If you\u2019re replacing one food with another, are you still getting the vitamins, minerals and other nutrition you need?\nIn a recent paper, I sought to raise awareness of nutritional differences between foods by producing a new index specific to Australia. It aims to help Australians make better informed dietary choices and get the nutrients recommended for good health.\nBefore you abandon your traditional food choices, it\u2019s important to consider the nutritional tradeoffs.\nShutterstock\nNutrients: are we getting enough?\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes tables showing the usual intake of selected nutrients across the population. The tables also show the proportion of Australians whose usual nutrient intake is below what\u2019s known as the \u201cestimated average requirement\u201d.\nWhile Australian adults eat in diverse ways, they generally get enough of some nutrients regardless of their diets.\nFor example, most people seem to obtain adequate niacin (Vitamin B3) and phosphorus. And the tables suggest 97% of Australians get enough vitamin C.\nHowever, inadequate intake of calcium, magnesium, vitamin B6 and zinc is common.\nAround two-thirds of Australian adults consume less calcium than what\u2019s recommended (which ranges from 840 to 1100 mg/day depending upon age). Worryingly, 90% of women aged over 50 don\u2019t get enough calcium.\nInadequate zinc intake is most prevalent among Australian men \u2013 more than half aged over 50 consume below recommended levels.\nSo what about free sugars? These include added sugars and the sugar component of honey and fruit juices, but exclude natural sugars in intact fruit, vegetables and milk.\nIt\u2019s recommended Australians limit free sugars to less than 10% of dietary energy intake. However, almost 50% of Australian adults exceed this recommended limit.\nWorryingly, 90% of women aged over 50 have calcium intake beklow what is recommended.\nShutterstock\nPaying attention to under-consumed nutrients\nEvery food has a different nutrient composition. And as the Australian Dietary Guidelines show, we should eat a variety of foods to stay healthy.\nWe should pay particular attention to foods that are important sources of nutrients for which large numbers of Australians are not getting enough. If possible, Australians should seek to include more of these foods in their diet.\nAt the same time, foods with free sugars should be eaten only in moderation.\nThe new food index I produced seeks to help Australians achieve this. It provides an overall nutrient composition score tailored to the Australian dietary context.\nThe index includes eight vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, Folate, A and C), eight minerals (calcium, phosphorus, zinc, iron, magnesium, iodine, selenium and molybdenum), along with protein and free sugars.\nThese 18 elements are weighted in proportion to the extent of inadequate or excessive intake in Australia. A higher score is better than a lower score.\nSo, the index scores foods highly if they are low in free sugars, and rich in the elements many Australians need more of \u2013 calcium, magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc and vitamin A.\nFoods containing few nutrients but added sugar score very low. For example, a chocolate chip cookie weighing 35 grams scored 0.004 and a sugar-sweetened cola-flavoured beverage scored below zero.\nFoods containing few nutrients but added sugar score very low in the index.\nMatt Dunham/AP\nSwapping foods may not achieve like-for-like\nThe index can be used to compare foods that might be considered substitutes in pursuit of a diet that\u2019s healthier, more affordable or better for the environment.\nIn the case of dairy foods, 250ml of full cream milk scored 0.160, and reduced-fat milk almost as high at 0.157.\nThe index shows the potential nutritional trade-offs when choosing dairy alternatives. A 250ml serving of calcium-fortified oat beverage scored 0.093. Without calcium fortification, the score fell to 0.034.\nLooking at meat, 100g of raw lean diced beef scored 0.142. An equivalent serving of plant-based burger made from pea protein, with many added vitamins and minerals, scored almost the same at 0.139. This shows plant-based alternatives are not necessarily less nutrient dense.\nThe index also shows the different nutritional needs of women and men. For example, the scores for two large eggs were higher for women (0.143) than men (0.094). This reflects, in part, the greater prevalence of inadequate iron intake among younger women.\nPackaging on unprocessed foods doesn\u2019t usually include nutrition information.\nShutterstock\nUnderstanding trade-offs\nTo date, comprehensive nutritional information about foods eaten in Australia has been found only in databases used by scientists and nutrition professionals.\nFor the average consumer, packaging on unprocessed foods \u2013 such as fruits and vegetables, fresh meats and some cheese \u2013 doesn\u2019t usually include nutrition information.\nConsumers can consult the nutrition information panel when buying processed foods, but only some nutrients are shown.\nI hope my research may prompt manufacturers produce more nutrient-dense foods or those formulated to meet the nutrient needs of a particular subgroup.\nIn future, I hope the index will also be translated into a user-friendly format or app that everyday Australians can consult, to ensure their changing food preferences result in a healthier choice.\nBrad Ridoutt, Principal Research Scientist, CSIRO Agriculture, CSIRO\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "content": "Avocado toast is inarguably one of the latest and greatest breakfast rages. Thanks to Food Network chef Giada De Laurentiis, though, it may need to step aside. The chef\u2019s comforting \u2014 and filling \u2014 Mushroom Toast might just become the next go-to breakfast trend. Here\u2019s how to make this decadent morning meal.\nCelebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis smiles for the camera at a 2019 Food Network event | Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images for NYCWFF\nDe Laurentiis\u2019 Mushroom Toast is great for breakfast or even a light dinner\nDescribing the humble breakfast offering in her 2021 book Eat Better, Feel Better: My Recipes for Wellness and Healing, Inside and Out, the chef writes, \u201cThis is no two-biter, like a crostini; it\u2019s a sophisticated, sexy dish that\u2019s perfect for brunch, lunch, or even a lighter dinner. Kale, mushrooms, and earthy Marsala wine make it super savory and meaty.\u201d\nDe Laurentiis notes that a fried or poached egg on top of the toast is optional, but makes for an extra filling breakfast: \u201cThe eggs, while not mandatory, bind all the elements together into a creamy, delicious mouthful.\u201d\nThis recipe calls for olive oil, one pound of assorted mushrooms \u201csuch as cremini, shiitake, or oyster,\u201d kosher salt, shallot, a bunch of Tuscan kale with the stems cut off, dry Marsala wine, unsalted butter, sliced rustic bread, whole grain mustard, and four eggs.\nFind the full recipe in De Laurentiis\u2019 cookbook, Eat Better, Feel Better, available wherever books are sold.\nGet Giada De Laurentiis\u2019 Mushroom Toast done in just a few steps\nThe chef starts this breakfast dish by cooking the mushrooms over medium to high heat in five tablespoons of olive oil. Add one chopped shallot, along with the washed and chopped kale. Take the pan off the heat to add the wine, at which time De Laurentiis notes this is a great time to \u201cscrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan\u201d using a wooden spoon.\nKeeping the pan off of the heat, it\u2019s time to stir about a tablespoon of butter into the mushroom sauce. Toast the sliced bread if preferred and spread it with mustard. Spoon the mushroom mixture onto each slice of toast and top, if desired, with an egg fried in oil. A tip from De Laurentiis for getting egg whites to set is to spoon \u201csome of the hot oil over the whites.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thoroughly Mediterranean dish that can be enjoyed any time of day.\nAnother twist on breakfast toast from the Italian-American chef\nAnd if you really like crunchy toast with filling protein in the mornings, De Laurentiis has another toasty offering. Serve De Laurentiis\u2019 Breakfast PLTs on mini-bagels topped with crispy pancetta, quail eggs, a combination of goat cheese and mustard, arugula, and tomato.

Kevin Kirshner\nclick to enlarge Casa Bonita announced Dana Rodriguez as its new executive chef. Evan Sem\u00f3n\nAfter a pair of indoor dining shutdowns and never-ending changes in rules and regulations upended the hospitality industry in 2020, restaurateurs were eager to welcome 2021. The year started out on a positive note when Governor Jared Polis announced that counties at level red (remember those color-coded days?) would move to level orange on January 4.That meant that dining rooms could reopen, and while there hasn't been another full-on shutdown of indoor dining since, 2021 came with its own set of challenges. From supply-chain issues to staffing shortages, restaurants and bars have continued to take hits. But most have persevered, in the process gaining fresh perspectives that could result in a stronger industry going forward.And hot chicken \u2014 there was a lot of that, too. Here are the ten biggest food stories of 2021:When indoor dining shut down in 2020, most owners and operators were forced to lay off a majority of their staffers. While out of work, many former restaurant and bar workers opted to leave the industry altogether, or set off to start their own new ventures. Why? The reasons are plentiful. Hospitality work has long been known for its grueling schedules, as well as questions about pay structure, mental health support and work/life balance. One thing most people in the industry agree on, though, is that the staffing shortage isn't simply the result of lazy people staying home to collect unemployment.As bars and restaurants look to fill empty positions, things have begun to shift. Some are adjusting hours, cutting brunch and lunch. Many have added service charges to their receipts and begun pooling tips to make pay more equitable. Mental well-being is at the forefront of conversations, and owners are implementing new benefits \u2014 and attitudes \u2014 in order to make their businesses more welcoming places to work.Staff wasn't the only thing in short supply in 2021. Everything from boba to chicken wings and rubber gloves to distilling equipment was affected by the widespread supply-chain issues caused by the pandemic. Furniture for new restaurants is on a months-long back order. Crayons for kids jumped in price. And food and drink offerings have had to be constantly adjusted depending on what's available at any given time. As a result, menu prices have been increasing steadily, too. It's not uncommon now to see $15 cocktails and $20 burgers, and that's a trend likely to continue into 2023.As in 2020, the rules for dining out were in flux this year, culminating in the current mask or vax order that leaves it up to restaurants and bars to decide whether to make vaccinations mandatory. Prior to that order, which went into effect on November 24 and is set to expire on January 3 (though an extension is likely), only one major restaurant group in town was requiring proof of vaccine to dine in. Bonanno Concepts officially implemented the policy on September 30, but now many others have done the same. Will that trend continue in 2022? Or will the city or state require proof of vaccination rather than leave it up to businesses? Only time will tell. But there's no question that many other pandemic-era changes, such as expanded outdoor dining and booze to go, will be sticking around.Over 100 more restaurants opened in 2021 than did the previous year \u2014 and the total of just under 300 isn't far behind the pre-pandemic numbers of 2019. While the city lost some beloved institutions like Beast + Bottle and Falling Rock Tap House over the past twelve months, the dining scene continues to grow and evolve in new and exciting ways \u2014 a testament to the strength and creativity of Denver's hospitality professionals. From the bright, whimsical Three Saints Revival , which feels like a dreamy escape from everyday realities, to the comforting Lucy's Burger Bar with its cheese-filled Juicy Lucys , fresh options abound \u2014 and that's something to celebrate.Starting a business in the midst of a global pandemic is challenging, to say the least. But despite the odds, a lot of scrappy companies and pop-ups gave new ventures a go in 2020 \u2014 and in 2021, many of them grew in unexpected ways. The Funky Flame founder Allison Declercq started selling bread made in a wood-fired oven at home in December 2020 and is now cooking pizza and more at the Radiator in Sunnyside and looking to open a brick-and-mortar in 2022. The team behind Split Lip started slinging burgers and hot chicken at pop-ups last summer; by this past September, the concept had moved into Number Thirty Eight and landed on our 2021 list of best new restaurants . For these entrepreneurs, the pandemic was a time to reassess their professional paths and bet on themselves \u2014 and now those bets are paying off.Ordering delivery and pick-up remains a popular way to dine, especially as new COVID variants continue to spread. Ghost kitchens give concepts a low-overhead path to start selling food, while established restaurants that survived for so long on only to-go business in 2020 continue to improve those options. Even fine-dining establishments like Olivia and Tavernetta have continued to offer to-go menus \u2014 a welcome option for those who prefer to avoid crowds but still want to enjoy a high-quality meal.The list of new restaurant openings in 2021 was long, but many of the names on that list didn't have local roots. New locations of concepts already established in other states have been cropping up in large numbers around the metro area. On the one hand, this means that companies view Denver as a viable market \u2014 a sign of the strength of the dining scene here. But that also makes it tougher for smaller operators to find affordable places to open, as they're unable to compete with bigger names backed by bigger money (think Giordano's and Federales). As Denver continues to grow, companies based outside of Colorado will continue to see it as an appealing market. We just hope that independent restaurants and bars continue to find ways to balance out the scene.This year, our list of the 100 bars we can't live without includes something new: a bar without booze. Awake opened in May , becoming Denver's first sober bar. While many people upped the ante on drinking while quarantined at home in 2020, non-alcoholic beverage options have been expanding in 2021. You can now find booze-free spirits on liquor-store shelves and cocktails options without the buzz on bar and restaurant menus all around town. Denver remains a city that loves cold beer and tipsy nights out, but it's also getting easier to take a break \u2014 or abstain completely \u2014 without having to resort to ordering tonic with a lime. Or simply staying home.If there's one food that landed hard in Denver in 2021, it was hot chicken. Although the concept has its roots in Nashville, this spicy specialty seems to be everywhere in the Mile High these days. The Los Angeles-based Dave's Hot Chicken now has two locations in Denver. Colorado's first hot chicken joint, Music City, made its way from Fort Collins to South Broadway, opening an outpost inside TRVE Brewing in August. Then there's Lea Jane's, Chicken Rebel, Split Lip, Lou's and more \u2014 though the scene got too hot for one concept: In early December, restaurateur Jared Leonard announced that he was closing his Budlong Hot Chicken location at 81 South Pennsylvania Street and would reopen it as Montreal-inspired Au Feu, a move motivated in part by the growing hot chicken competition in town \u2014 a possible sign that this trend could be cooling.The future of the pink eatertainment palace, which has been closed since March 2020, looked uncertain for much of the year. In April, Casa Bonita's owner filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , and while a local group led by Casa Bonita aficionado Andrew Novick stepped in to try and save the landmark , no deal emerged. But then the rumors started. There were rumblings that Colorado natives Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of(which immortalized Casa Bonita in a 2003 episode),might actually purchase it. Governor Jared Polis confirmed the news in an interview with Parker and Stone in August; by September, the deal was official. The latest twist in the saga could have been pulled straight from an episode of: Dana Rodriguez, who once applied to work in Casa Bonita's kitchen only to be told she didn't have enough experience, will become its executive chef. The sopaipillas will remain, she says, but the food will certainly be improved \u2014 ensuring that one of the most anticipated moments to come in 2022 will be the reopening of this Lakewood icon.",

            "content": "FRESNO, Calif. -- You've seen those delicious-looking hot chocolate bombs all over your TikTok feed.You've oohed and aahed at videos of them 'exploding' into a cluster of marshmallows bathed in chocolate milk.You may even have indulged in the sheer joy of them yourself during the bleak pandemic days.But we bet you didn't know where they first began - in the kitchen of one California business that had no idea it was launching a worldwide food trend.\"An October morning two years ago, I woke up to my phone just going crazy,\" recalls Max Debbas.Max is the president of Debbas Gourmet, a family-owned chocolatier in Fresno.Over 40 years, they've grown from a small ice cream shop run by Max's father and mother, to a large manufacturer of handcrafted chocolate products with customers around the world.Still, that success had not prepared him for the kind of colossal sales that were coming his way - beginning that October morning, when call after call about the viral fame of hot chocolate bombs poured in.Debbas Gourmet was the first to come up with the concept of chocolate bombs years ago, he says. The company had been producing them from 100% chocolate for private label customers since 2017.There were no products like that for several years until around 2019, when other companies began making them, but from cocoa instead of chocolate.Then in the winter of 2019, some inventive TikTokers came up with their own recipes to make cocoa bombs at home - and a viral food trend was born.Around that time, Debbas Gourmet had recently launched their own label, A'cappella, and were selling the hot chocolate bombs as 'BevBombs' under it.And overnight, their sales skyrocketed.\"It literally blew up,\" he says. \"We were getting calls from everybody, Costco, a lot of people... so we quickly began producing them at full speed, and we haven't slowed down since.\"Not only have they not slowed down, they've now launched multiple new flavors of the Bev Bombs.Besides the classic chocolate original, you can now buy them in chocolate raspberry, white chocolate peppermint, and pumpkin spice.Max says each bomb is made from real chocolate.\"We use all-natural ingredients, there's nothing artificial, no flavors, no fake chocolate or coating,\" he says. \"The marshmallows, even, they're gelatin-free, they're kosher, all made by hand.\"If you want to try Bev Bombs, you can buy them from Costco or from the Debbas Gourmet website",

            "content": "There has been so much talk over wages, worker shortages and businesses closing because of the pandemic.\nNow, there is an issue at a store in a Rochester mall called Hot Topic. We do have one of those stores here in the Crossroads Mall as well, but this one was in the Apache Mall in Rochester. There was a sign placed on the store front that went viral over the weekend.\nIt simply stated that since they won't pay a \"living wage\" they aren't going to work there anymore. This is giving the idea that they have gone elsewhere to find higher paying jobs. This is coming after several other signs were placed on store fronts and food court restaurants in the Apache Mall stating that \"we're closed because no one wants to work anymore\". This one might be worse.\nShanice Mxnique- Facebook\nBring Me the News says that they did try and reach out to the California-based company, but so far they have not responded.\nI have heard several small business owners saying that if they pay $15-$20 an hour to all of their employees, they would have to close down. So what they do is run short staffed and pay the employees that they do have those wages. This is only in some cases.\nThis particular store, Hot Topic, has about 700 stores nationwide. One would think, without going over their financials, that they could afford to pay more than what I'm guessing is probably about $10-$11 an hour. But still in recovery mode from the pandemic, who really knows what the situation is? One thing is for sure- the employees aren't happy. These are mostly part-time employees, some full-time, but this is what most retailers pay. This needs to change, or people just will continue on this trajectory of not working or finding other jobs. This is also a place where you aren't going to work for tips like in the food industry. So any extra pay would have to come from regular pay increases.\nThe last time I was in the Crossroads Mall in St Cloud, Hot Topic was still open.

In fact, it was listed as the No. 1 trend in Whole Foods\u2019 list of top food trends in 2022. I am also excited about the potential for growth in vertical farming, and I made that the topic of The Stockout show the past two weeks on which I interviewed supply chain executives from Plenty and Freight Farms. Those two companies are taking widely different approaches to vertical farming: Freight Farms sells equipment in the form of hydroponic containers to enterprising small farmers, whereas Plenty is building its own large-scale indoor farms, leveraging its own research on growing conditions and selling produce through retail channels.\nVertical farming intrigues me due to the potential environmental benefits (reduced diesel usage, reduced water usage, lack of pesticides) and the potential for improvements in living standards (being able to deliver fresh produce to locations that are underserved and/or have poor natural growing conditions). At some point, with enough scale and with further cost reductions to LED technology, vertical farming could become more economical than traditional farming, benefiting from efficiencies in labor, transportation and other inputs, such as pesticides. In addition, vertical farming output has the potential to be higher-quality and more consistent since growing conditions can be optimized perfectly without interference from adverse weather or pests.\nMuch of the indoor farming done to date has been leafy greens, such as lettuce, since that is the food category for which it is easiest to \u201cmake the numbers work.\u201d But, it is clear that the larger companies are also pursuing higher-value produce, as seen in Plenty\u2019s partnership with Driscoll\u2019s to grow strawberries indoors. Another development in vertical farming that I find interesting is that a cluster of vertical farming startups are located in Israel, presumably a result of poor growing conditions and remoteness from agricultural regions.\nSpot rates to move produce from central California have been highly inflationary. In traditional farming methods, lettuce requires very specific growing conditions and must be hauled in temperature-controlled trailers. The limited areas where it can grow include the Salinas Valley (included as part of the San Francisco metro area in SONAR) in the spring and summer and Yuma, Arizona (part of the Phoenix market in SONAR data). The chart below shows that, in the past five years, the all-inclusive truckload costs to move produce from central California to Chicago have been as low as $4,000 a load but reached a high of $8,550 this year. With vertical farming, that cost and volatility could be reduced by growing lettuce closer to consumption centers.\nWeekly average total truckload price (all inclusive) based on a USDA survey of produce shippers.\nThe biggest news in the CPG industry the past few days has been The Coca-Cola Co. acquiring full ownership position of sport drink company BodyArmor. The acquisition price is $5.6 billion for the remaining 85% of the company that Coke did not already own. BodyArmor will be managed as a separate business and will retain its New York headquarters. Coke expects BodyArmor to have sales of about $1.4 billion this year, which gives the brand an 18% share of the $8.4 billion U.S. sports drink market. This acquisition is consistent with Coke\u2019s strategy of becoming a \u201ctotal beverage company\u201d that also included its 2018 acquisition of Costa Coffee and its 2017 acquisition of Topo Chico. In addition, the acquisition provides an avenue for growth; the $1.4 billion in expected sales of BodyArmor sports drinks this year reflects sharp growth from $250 million in 2018 sales.\nDirect-to-consumer brands may have to adapt to new data privacy rules. Brian Straight, managing editor of Modern Shipper, explains why changes to data policies regarding cookies could be an issue for many consumer goods companies, particularly those that rely on the internet for their marketing. According to e-commerce company BigCommerce, the most important role for a cookie is to keep users logged to a particular website while they browse other sites. A user\u2019s browsing history then becomes part of a database, which the original website uses for more customized and targeted output. Recent policy changes by many of the large tech companies differentiate between first-party cookies (websites you visit) and third-party cookies (outside sites that track your data). Consumer goods companies need to adapt to no longer relying on third-party cookies now and can do so by enhancing their loyalty programs, newsletters and other actions that can personalize customers\u2019 experiences without making customers feel like they are constantly being watched.\nTo sign up for The Stockout, a free newsletter focused on CPG supply chains, please click here.",

            "content": "Nestle tests realistic plant-based shrimp and eggs amid vegan trend\nNestle has announced the launch of two new plant-based food products meant to serve as alternatives to shrimp and eggs. The company uses a variety of plant-based proteins and other ingredients to mimic the texture and appearance of eggs and shrimp without animal-based products, meaning both products are suitable for vegans.\nNestle calls its new plant-based egg alternative \u2018Garden Gourmet vEGGie.\u2019 The product is made using omega-3 fatty acids and soy protein; Nestle says the product can be scrambled like actual eggs, making it suitable for use as a substitute for recipes that require eggs. According to the company, vEGGie has a Nutri-Score A rating in Europe.\nThe new plant-based shrimp alternative, meanwhile, is called Garden Gourmet Vrimp, and it is likewise made from a variety of plant ingredients. Nestle says its shrimp alternative features peas, konjac root, and seaweed, offering an \u201cauthentic texture and flavor\u201d while reaching a Nutri-Score B rating in Europe.\nNestle says that among other things, its plant-based \u2018vrimp\u2019 can be stir-fried like actual shrimp. The company previously launched a plant-based tuna alternative called \u2018Vuna\u2019 in select European countries, including Germany and Italy. While plant-based meat alternatives have become more popular, seafood varieties are less common.\nNestle is launching its shrimp and egg alternatives in some German and Swiss stores as test markets for the products. Both Vrimp and vEGGie were developed in Germany and Switzerland at Nestle Research and R&D Center. It\u2019s unclear when the company plans to expand the availability of these products to other markets.",

            "description": "A video with over 10 million views joked about putting the ice into the fryer, but one copycat user actually tried it out and it ended with dangerous results.",
            "content": "A trend in its beginnings on TikTok is already a concern, as it sees a Popeyes worker pour a basket of ice into boiling oil.\nThe video gained over 18 million views in just two days, as the oil bubbled out of the deep fryer, paired with shouting from the worker.\nAs reported by Mashed, the video trend is just in its very beginnings, after it began as a semi-joke by user @tyroedodd1. Dodd jokingly posted a video from the kitchen of a fast food restaurant, approaching the fryer with a basket of ice.\n\"I'm sick of this job,\" they wrote on-screen. Although the basket appeared to be about to be dunked straight into the deep fryer, the video stopped just before.\nAfter being uploaded last week, the post has gained over 10 million views, and sparked one dangerous copy-cat video.\nTwo days ago, a Louisiana Popeyes worker posted a similar video to their account, @michaelcazeau46, but actually went through with the dangerous act. Tagged as \"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen\" the worker approached the fryer before dunking the basket of ice into it.\nThe hot oil visibly reacted with the ice, bubbling up immediately before overflowing and pouring out of the sides of the fryer. \"Take it out,\" repeated an off-camera voice.\n\"Should I try two cups of ice?\" they asked in a comment with 62,000 likes, as they added that a part two is coming.\n\"This trend isn't going to end well,\" commented one user.\nMixing ice and hot oil is extremely dangerous, as explained by firefighter and TikToker @firedepartmentchronicles, who reacted to the video. \"Just remember two things before you try the newest Darwinism challenge. Number one, water expands 1,700 times its normal size when it's converted to steam. Number two, it's really hard to call 911 when you're screaming in pain when you're covered in boiling hot grease,\" he said.\nThe ice's sudden change of state when it hits the boiling oil leads to an extremely violent reaction. The more ice added, the worse the reaction will be, meaning the trend could lead to even more extreme reactions than that of Cazeau's video\u2014including a potential burst of flame.\nAs shown by various videos across YouTube, which experiment with the mixture, pouring ice into hot oil can lead to huge flames. A popular video, aptly titled, \"This Is Why You Should NEVER Throw Ice Cubes Into a Deep Fat Fryer!!\" showed the oil bubbling up, before suddenly bursting into flames.\nOne basket of ice may not have led to such a reaction, but the promise of doubling it up looks likely to.\nNewsweek has contacted TikTok and @michaelcazeau for comment.",

            "description": "Global record high natural gas prices are pushing some energy-intensive companies to curtail production in a trend that is adding to disruptions to global supply chains in some sectors such as food and could result in higher costs being passed on to their customers.",
            "content": "LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Global record high natural gas prices are pushing some energy-intensive companies to curtail production in a trend that is adding to disruptions to global supply chains in some sectors such as food and could result in higher costs being passed on to their customers.\nSome companies, including steel producers, fertiliser manufacturers and glass makers, have had to suspend or reduce production in Europe and Asia as a result of spiking energy prices. That includes two of the world\u2019s largest fertiliser makers, which said they would cut production in Europe. The UK on Tuesday said it agreed to provide state support to one of the companies to restart production of by-product carbon dioxide, which is used in food production, to avert a supply crunch. read more\nNatural gas prices have risen sharply around the globe in recent months. That has been due to a combination of factors: including increased demand particularly from Asia due to a post-pandemic recovery; low gas inventories; and tighter-than-usual gas supplies from Russia.\nGas prices in Europe have risen more than 250% this year, while Asia has seen about a 175% increase since late January. In the United States, prices have surged to multi-year highs and are about double where they were at the start of the year. Electricity prices have also risen sharply as many power plants are gas-fired.\nIndustrial Energy Consumers of America, a trade group representing chemical, food and materials manufacturers, has in recent days called on the U.S. Department of Energy to stop the country's liquefied natural gas producers from exporting gas to help keep the energy costs down for industry. read more\nAdditional supplies of gas could alleviate pressure. Norway has allowed increased gas exports. More supply could flow from Russia by the end of the year with the country\u2019s new Nord Stream 2 pipeline awaiting approval from Germany\u2019s energy regulator. The pipeline project has drawn criticism from the United States, which says it will increase Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy supplies. read more\nPRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS\nThe pressures so far have been particularly acute in Europe, where gas stocks are much lower than usual heading into winter. Norway\u2019s Yara International ASA (YAR.OL), one of the world\u2019s largest fertiliser makers, on Friday said it would cut about 40% of its European ammonia production due to high gas prices. That came after U.S.-based CF Industries Holdings Inc (CF.N) said gas prices were prompting it to halt operations at two of its British plants. Natural gas is the most important cost input for nitrogen-based chemicals and fertilizers. read more\nYara\u2019s chief executive, Svein Tore Holsether, told Reuters in an interview Monday that the company was bringing ammonia to Europe from production facilities elsewhere, including the United States and Australia. \"Instead of using European gas, we are essentially using gas from other parts of the world to make that product and bring it into Europe,\" he said. read more CF Industries didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nSome industries are calling on governments to intervene on their behalf. These pleas come as some countries have acted to protect consumers from soaring energy bills, such as Spain, which last week approved a package of measures including price caps.\nAmong those asking for help is the food industry following a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by the suspension of production in some fertiliser plants. CO2 is used in the vacuum packing of food products to extend their shelf life, to stun animals before slaughter and to put the fizz in soft drinks and beer.\nIn the UK, meat processors had warned they will run out of CO2 within five days, forcing them to halt production. Soft drink manufacturers, who rely on the gas to make carbonated drinks, said supplies were running low. read more\nOn Tuesday, the British government said it struck a three-week deal with CF Industries for the American company to restart the production of carbon dioxide in the UK. Britain\u2019s environment minister, who said the state support could run into tens of millions of pounds, also warned the food industry that carbon dioxide prices would rise sharply.\nCF Industries said in a statement it is immediately restarting ammonia production at its Billingham plant following the agreement.\nWEATHERING THE STORM\nOther energy-intensive sectors such as steel and cement are also feeling the pinch.\nSoaring gas prices have in the past couple of weeks \"forced some steelmakers to suspend operations during those periods of the night and day when the cost of energy rockets,\" said Gareth Stace, director general at industry group UK Steel. He declined to identify which companies.\nBritish Steel, the country\u2019s second-largest steel producer, said it was maintaining normal levels of production but that the \u201ccolossal\u201d energy-price increases made \u201cit impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day.\u201d\nSome manufacturers say they are able to cope, so far.\nGermany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp AG, (TKAG.DE) Europe\u2019s second-largest steelmaker, said hedging mechanisms it had in place against energy price increases, especially gas, meant it was not curbing production. But it said it was indirectly affected because the industrial gases it used are linked to electricity prices.\nHeidelbergCement AG (HEIG.DE) of Germany, the world\u2019s second-largest cement maker, said higher energy prices were driving up production costs but that operations had not been halted as a result.\nIn China, several steel, ceramic and glass makers have reduced production to avoid losses, according to Li Ruipeng, a local supplier of liquefied natural gas in the northern province of Hebei. And, China\u2019s southwestern province of Yunnan this month imposed limits on production of some heavy industries, including producers of fertilisers, cement, chemicals, and aluminium smelters due to energy shortages, a move that analysts said could reduce exports.\nTo weather the storm, some energy-intensive industries and utility firms in Asia and the Middle East have temporarily switched from gas to fuel oil, crude, naphtha or coal, analysts and traders said. That trend is expected to continue for the rest of the year and into the beginning of next, according to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog.\nIn Europe, demand for coal as an alternative power source has also risen significantly. But options for switching to alternative sources of energy are limited in the region largely due to government policies aimed at encouraging the use of gas over more polluting fuels such as coal.\nThe glass industry was historically run on fuel oil, but almost all sites in the United Kingdom have now transitioned to natural gas, according to Paul Pearcy, federation coordinator at British Glass, a UK trade association. Only a few sites have fuel oil tanks that enable them to switch energy source if prices skyrocket, he added.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Susanna Twidale in London, Roslan Khasawneh in Singapore Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, Nigel Hunt, Eric Onstad and Ahmad Ghaddar in London, Jessica Jaganathan and Chen Aizhu in Singapore, Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo, Nidhi Verma in Delhi, Scott DiSavino in New York, Heekyong Yang in Seoul, and Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt, Tom Kaeckenhoff in D\u00fcsseldorf, Polina Devitt in Moscow, Arathy S Nair in Houston Editing by Cassell Bryan-Low\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "The trend has racked up a collective 80 million views, but experts have advice on how to avoid harming ants while doing it.",
            "content": "Cat videos might be the golden child of the internet animal kingdom, but ants are fast taking over TikTok, as people set up \"ant restaurants\" for the insects.\nThe trend sees users place various foods onto pieces of cardboard and label them appropriately. It doesn't take long for hoards of ants to choose to dine at the hottest, albeit only, restaurant in town.\n@finn.tuna.gnocchi made the most popular restaurant on the app, gaining over 31 million views on their July upload, which used food coloring on honey. At one point a worm, or suspected \"critic\" as they dubbed him, joined in.\nIn fact, the TikTok user created a whole series of restaurants after the flagship's success, adding a beach-themed restaurant made from biscuits and candy to its repertoire.\nThe TikTok \"ant restaurants\" tend to use anything left in a cupboard, but Sean Boscott, from ant supplier British Ants, suggests any future restaurant owners go with proteins. \"Sugary treats are great, but if you really want to help them out, proteins are the way forward. We supply protein jellies that are sweet for the ants but provide essential proteins that queen ants require to support the laying of thousands of eggs a day.\"\n\"Proteins such as goldfish flakes, crushed dead mealy worms from the bird feeder and dead insects would be a better way forward,\" he added.\nAnts have \"social stomachs\" and through the process of trophallaxis, will take back and pass on collected liquids back to the nest in equal amounts.\nLike most TikTok trends however, there is a potential risk with ant restaurants that prove that you can have too much of a good thing. \"It looks like a bit of fun, but in reality you might be doing more harm. As the food dries up in the sun, they're inclined to get stuck in the food source, become trapped and die,\" warned Boscott.\n\"Ants are also known for helping their sisters when distressed, leading to more becoming trapped,\" he added.\nIn one popular video on the app, an ant can be seen floating in a large amount of ranch, presumed drowned in the food, while another dead ant can be seen in a dollop of honey in another clip.\n\"I did this with honey and the ants drowned,\" commented one user.\nAs for where to place the restaurant, an up-and-coming borough might be sought after for New York, but in a bug's life, it's anywhere in a garden. \"If you've got a garden, then you've probably got ants in there,\" explained Adam Hart, an entomologist and professor of science communication at the University of Gloucestershire. \"Ants are really good at exploring, and once they've found food, they're really good at telling their nestmates where that food is. So they'll lay down their pheromone trails, and they'll get back to the nest.\"\nThere is a way around this though. Simply diluting the sticky foods like honey and jam with water, \"thins it out and makes it easier for them to take in whilst reducing risk if they get stuck,\" said Boscott.\n\"Only offer small amounts at a time, a grain of sugar to an ant is equivalent to a 2.2lb bag of rice for us,\" he added.\nThe restaurant might be interesting enough as it is, but another cool test TikToking enthusiasts can try includes discovering which brand's food is the purest, suggest Boscott.\n\"Lay various brands of the same food out and watch the ants select the purest. Most humans wouldn't know without checking the label but ants will always go for the purest forms of food when given a choice,\" he explained.\nThat's not to say they are food snobs, though. \"Pretty much anything you can put out that they'll take, they'll be happy with,\" said Hart. \"They may not come and collect it again, if they turn out that they don't like it, because they're often feeding it to their larvae, and then sort all sorts of clever communication in the nest to make sure that they're doing the right thing.\"\nWith over 80 million views, the ant restaurants are taking over TikTok and shining a light on a somewhat forgotten insect\u2014just make sure to do it in the best way possible for them.\n\"It's cool that people are interested in looking at ants and that people are starting to use social media to appreciate the smaller things in life like ants,\" summarized Hart on the trend.",

            "content": "Although honey may be very sweet, a recent trend on TikTok seems to be leaving a bitter taste for many viewers online.\nOne of the newest trends on the video-sharing app involved people freezing honey for up to eight hours then chewing on it once it has become a gel.\nThe trend has gained a massive amount of popularity in recent weeks on TikTok, and the hashtag Frozenhoney currently already has a whopping 824 million views.\nRead more 15 Kitchen Hacks That Will Change Your Life 15 Kitchen Hacks That Will Change Your Life\nHowever, while the snack may suit those who have a sweet tooth, many have warned against doing the food hack as it could also not be particularly healthy.\nAlthough the origin of the craze is not known, TikToker Lalaeluu tried out the trend on July 25, in a video that can be seen here, and it has so far been seen by 7.3 million people and garnered 1 million likes.\nDespite eating the food and saying that, \"It tastes like honey but its good though\" she also captioned the post: \"Note to self: Don't eat three mouthfuls of honey in the morning, it will cause urgent bowl movements.\"\n@lalaleluu Reply to @sqiudward_smells Note to self: don\u2019t eat three mouthfuls of honey in the morning, it will cause urgent bowel movement \u266c original sound - Lala\nHer review was also confirmed by others including TikTok user Sabicos who commented: \"I did that and ate too much and got sick.\"\nHealth Impact of Eating Too Much Honey\nWhile there haven't been many studies on frozen honey, eating too much of the sweet condiment can increase the risk of contracting botulism. The botulinum bacteria cannot be killed by freezing.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, raw honey is a potential source of botulism spores. NIH explains: \"Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The bacteria may enter the body through wounds, or by eating them from improperly canned or preserved food.\"\nThe CDC advises: \"Honey can contain spores of C. botulinum and has been a source of infection for infants. Children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.\"\nAlthough that may be rare problem with ingesting too much honey, the condiment is also high in fructose which can cause a spike in blood sugar levels. This can be especially dangerous for diabetics. Due to its high sugar count too much honey can also cause tooth decay.\nThe recommended portion of sugar is 36 grams per day for men, and 24 grams for women and children, according to The American Heart Association. A tablespoon of honey contains around 17 grams of sugars, according to the USDA's FoodData Central website, so it should be eaten sparingly as it could cause obesity and increase risk of heart disease, among other conditions.\nAnother recent food trend which was doing the rounds on TikTok was a hack for poaching an egg in a microwave. However, this method has been proven to be dangerous as Chantelle Conway, 25, revealed on the app that it had resulted in horrific burns on her face and neck.",

It has been a staple of YouTube channels devoted to autonomous sensory meridian response, also known as ASMR, in which content creators eat frozen honey to create sounds that some people find relaxing.\nSome on TikTok claimed that after they tried the honey, they felt sick or were running for the bathroom with diarrhea.\n\"I feel sick now,\" a user wrote beneath a video of herself trying the trend.\n\"[Be right back] gotta go get my stomach pumped,\" another user joked.\nPart of the issue is just how much honey the people are consuming \u2014 while experts say small amounts of honey aren't a health concern, eating a fifth or more of a bottle can be a sugar overload.\n\"Honey is great, but having it in small amounts to sweeten is really a healthy relationship with food, and using it to get a lot of followers and a lot of attention and having it in excess amounts is crazy,\" said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic.\nYoung people who are interested in gobbling up bottles of frozen honey should think twice, experts warned, as they could experience diarrhea, stomach cramping, bloating and other adverse effects.\nAbout 1 in 3 people has dietary fructose intolerance, also called fructose malabsorption, which means the cells in the intestines don't absorb fructose the way they should, causing gastrointestinal distress, Kirkpatrick said.\n\"I don't see a huge risk with the short-term aspect for someone who has this fructose malabsorption other than what they're going to experience, which is awful diarrhea, stomach pain and things like that because they're not breaking it down correctly,\" she said.\nAnother concern is the potential, albeit small, risk of botulism for those who try the trend with raw honey.\n\"It's thought to be fine in adults, but a large load might potentially be problematic,\" said Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. \"Clearly, if teenagers are having too much that could be problematic.\"\nExperts said they also worried that the sticky substance could hurt people's teeth, cause cavities and pull out fillings.\nFor those who try the frozen honey trend only once, nutrition experts said, major ramifications aren't likely, aside from a stomachache.\nBut those who have gained views by making different kind of honeys and honey-like frozen candy concoctions and have repeatedly posted videos consuming them could be at risk for weight gain, disordered eating and other health risks.\n\"I worry about kids' going on TikTok to get their information and then following the latest trend and not tuning in to their own, internal stomach,\" Young said. \"If you try this trend once in a while and you get a stomachache \u2014 just because everyone else is doing it \u2014 be independent and you don't have to do it, either.\"",

Try refreshing your browser, or Karen Gordon: Sushi bake, despite the name, is nothing like real sushi Back to video I\u2019m no sushi connoisseur but I\u2019ve certainly eaten my fair share of it. I can attest that sushi bake is unlike any sushi you\u2019ve ever eaten. It\u2019s a novel concept with origins in the Philippines and Hawaii. While it has the word sushi in it, it\u2019s really nothing like real sushi. In other words, it contains no raw fish and it\u2019s not even rolled. While it has the trappings of sushi, like rice and nori \u2014 Japanese dried seaweed \u2014 that\u2019s where the similarities end. Sushi bake is served warm, in a casserole dish, family style. It\u2019s a deconstructed sushi roll served on top of Nori. It\u2019s a layer of deliciously seasoned sushi rice, creamy and cheesy crabmeat, topped with a generous drizzle of Japanese kewpie mayo, unagi sauce and then baked until slightly caramelized. It\u2019s then cut into 1-1/2\u201d by 3\u201d size pieces or scooped with a spoon onto pieces of nori, folded up and eaten like a Mexican taco. It\u2019s great for those who find eating raw fish a little intimidating.\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content And for those who love their California rolls, then this is the dish for you. The rice is warm, sticky, and slightly tangy, while the filling is rich, creamy and decadent. The combination is simply delicious! There are many ways of making sushi bakes. In its most basic form, it consists of a layer of sushi rice topped with a creamy mixture of imitation crabmeat, Japanese kewpie mayo, cream cheese and then baked until warm and slightly caramelized. However, other ingredients like cooked flaked salmon, crabmeat, tobiko also known as flying fish roe, avocado, green onions, unagi (eel sauce) and sriracha may also be added to add another layer of deliciousness to the dish. Here are a few tips for making a knockout sushi bake:\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u2022 Use Japanese short-grain sushi rice. It\u2019s stickier than white rice and is used specifically for sushi making. It\u2019s sticky with a chewy bite. \u2022 Use a good, seasoned rice vinegar. My personal favourite is Marukan Seasoned Gourmet Rice Vinegar available in the Asian section of supermarkets. \u2022 Wash the rice well before cooking. This helps get rid of excess starch and prevents gumminess. \u2022 Add the vinegar mixture to the rice when the rice is hot. This will help the rice to absorb the flavour of the vinegar and give it that deliciously tangy flavour. \u2022 Use butter to grease the baking dish to prevent sticking. While you can use olive oil, butter adds additional flavour and another level of richness to the dish. \u2022 Cool the rice before compressing it in the casserole pan. Cooled rice will hold its shape, reducing the chance of the sushi bake falling apart when removing it from the pan.\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u2022 Use Kewpie Japanese-style mayonnaise. Unlike regular mayo, Kewpie mayo is thicker and richer tasting. It\u2019s also a little sweeter and tangier which adds another level of complexity to the dish. \u2022 Don\u2019t skip the Furikake. Furikake (pronounced as foo-ree-kar-kay) is a Japanese condiment that adds a briny, umami taste to the sushi bake. It simply won\u2019t be the same without it! Photo by Karen Gordon / PNG California Style Sushi Bake Sushi Rice: 2 cups raw sushi rice 3 cups cold water 3 tbsp seasoned rice wine vinegar 1/8 tsp salt 1 tsp granulated sugar Filling: 1 lb. (480g) imitation crabmeat, chopped 1 block (250g) cream cheese, softened to room temperature 1/2 cup Kewpie mayo 1 tbsp sriracha sauce, more or less to taste 1/2 tsp sesame oil 1/8 cup tobiko, raw flying fish roe\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Topping: Furikake Kewpie Mayo Unagi Sauce Roasted seaweed flakes (optional) Green onions, chopped Dried nori seaweed sheets or roasted seaweed packets Soy sauce (optional) Instructions: Rinse rice very well under cold running water. Once the water runs clear, drain, and add 3 cups of cold water. Cook rice in a rice-cooker until done. In a separate bowl, add the seasoned rice wine vinegar, salt, and granulated sugar. Whisk until the salt and sugar is dissolved. Once the rice is done, fluff the rice lightly, immediately add the seasoned vinegar to the hot rice. Continue mixing gently. Do not mush up the rice. Once the grains are well seasoned, set the rice aside to cool. While rice is cooling, prepare the filling.\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content In a medium size mixing bowl, add the cream cheese. Using a wooden spoon, mash up the cream cheese and stir until smooth. Add the mayo, sriracha, and sesame oil. Stir to combine. Add the chopped imitation crabmeat and tobiko. Stir well to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter a 9\u00d713\u201d casserole dish. Add the cooled seasoned rice. Using the back of a wooden spoon, compress the rice into the pan, creating an even layer. Sprinkle Furikake over the rice then top with the imitation crab mixture. Using the back of a spoon, spread the crab mixture evenly over the rice. Drizzle kewpie mayo in a diagonal pattern over the crab mixture. Then drizzle sriracha in the opposite direction, creating a cross-hatch pattern. Sprinkle roasted seaweed flakes, if using. Bake for approximately 15 minutes until the top is caramelized and bubbly. Remove from the oven and garnish with chopped green onions. Using a knife, slice the sushi bake into pieces measuring 1-1/2\u201d wide by 3\u201d long. Then use a spatula to lift and remove the sushi bake from the pan. To serve, place sushi bake on top of a piece of seaweed. Dip in soy sauce, if using, before eating. Enjoy!

            "title": "This is the pandemic food trend you need to try",
            "description": "A deconstructed sushi roll in a casserole format? Yes, please.",
            "content": "Sourdough and dalgona coffee may have gotten the bulk of pandemic food trend headlines, but fans of Filipino cooking likely had their social media feeds bombarded with pictures of the sushi bake as well.\nWhat is the sushi bake? In essence it\u2019s a sushi roll but deconstructed as a layered casserole. It usually starts with a bottom layer of sushi rice and is then topped with the stuff you\u2019d get in a California or Philly roll, or whatever the cook has on hand. Sheets of nori are served on the side where diners can scoop the rice into it like a wrap.\nWhile the sushi bake already existed for a few years, the pandemic catapulted it into viral fame, starting with home cooks in the Philippines before the trend reached Canada.\nWhile cafes and dessert spots have fully embraced dalgona-flavoured everything, Diona Joyce, owner of the Kanto by Tita Flips stall at the Market 707 outdoor food court, and the Tita Flips restaurant and catering company in the Junction, doesn\u2019t expect the sushi bake to dominate restaurant menus. In the realm of pandemic food trends at Filipino restaurants, the take-home kamayan has been a more ubiquitous hit as cooks condensed a table-sized feast into pizza boxes (Joyce prefers the sturdier aluminum tray for hers).\nJoyce first heard of the sushi bake when one of her regular customers requested it at the start of the pandemic.\n\u201cI saw it on my (social media) feeds with a lot of home bakers so I spent a week trying to make one myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe offer it on the catering side because it\u2019s so different from our restaurant menu, and it\u2019s not something you can just make quickly for takeout. It\u2019s mostly Filipinos who order it because I don\u2019t know if the non-Filipinos even heard of it.\u201d\nAs an off-menu special request at Tita Flips, sushi bake starts at $20 to $25 for an eight-inch circular casserole that will feed between two and four people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the layering of flavours,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cStart with good sushi rice and then you want something crispy. You also need a balance of flavours, something sweet or a little bit sour and salty.\u201d\nThe toppings vary, but the kani version (think California roll) is the most basic: on top of warm sushi rice is imitation crab, sweet corn, cream cheese, avocado, tobiko, kewpie mayo and okonomiyaki sauce (think of it as a sweet-and-sour Japanese version of barbecue sauce).\nThe salmon version has Joyce blowtorching chunks of raw salmon until they\u2019re slightly charred to give off a smoky aroma to contrast the sharp acidity of Sriracha and the smoothness of the kewpie (there\u2019s also a scallop version).\nBut the version Joyce is most proud of is the one with more traditional Filipino toppings: pork cracklings, sisig (chopped pig ears and snouts), lechon kawali (crispy pork belly) and lots of garlic (she has also done versions with adobo and bistek). It\u2019s a deceptively filling dish.\nWhile pandemic food trends come and go (anyone still growing their own green onions?), the sushi bake does have some signs it could have a bit of longevity: it\u2019s a relatively easy-to-make dish that comes with the comfort of casseroles, which can be made plain or fancy.\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying at home and trapped with two or four people in a household so it\u2019s something different to have,\u201d said Joyce. \u201cThe innovation comes from not having the skills to make sushi, so people are like, we\u2019ll make this instead.\u201d",

            "content": "Ceviche and hibiscus tostada at Fonda Fora restaurant in Calgary, Alberta, on Sept. 9, 2021.Todd Korol/Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail\nAs COVID-19 marches onward for the foreseeable future, restaurants are more keen on successful operations as opposed to chasing a cool new ingredient or cooking technique. This will not be \u201cthe year of broccoli\u201d or anything of the sort. Instead it will be a year of large-scale mentality changes in an industry that continues to find itself in flux.\nWhile some of the accompanying shifts could be viewed as a rising trend (or hope) in the eye of the beholder, others feel like notable tidal waves.\nNon-alcoholic craft drinks as menu mainstays\nWhile the idea of a non-alcoholic beer is nothing new (looking at you, O\u2019Douls), the drink category has seen massive growth over the past couple of years. Now, many Canadian craft brewers have set out to create their own booze-free brews under their own brand or as new subbrands.\nHarmon\u2019s Organic, from one of the co-founders of Toronto\u2019s Mill Street Brewery, is the latest offering to hit the market nationally, while other producers such as Libra and Sober Carpenter have been gaining popularity for some time. Locally in Calgary you can easily find non-alcoholic beers by Partake, One For The Road, Village Brewery and Tool Shed Brewing at liquor stores, select grocers and, of course, some pubs and restaurants too.\nThe proliferation of non-alcoholic drinks applies to \u201cspirits\u201d as well. One can now track down all sorts of alternative products that draw inspiration from amaro, Aperol, gin and more.\nWill we see a non-alcoholic \u201cliquor\u201d store pop up in the Prairies this year? I\u2019d say it is not out of the realm of possibility.\nDiversity at hospitality awards, festivals and events\nSocial media platforms and recent culinary television productions are to thank for helping create a new crop of food personalities that better showcase Canada\u2019s diverse population. Top Chef Canada\u2019s 2021 season making a star out of non-binary chef Kym Nguyen is a perfect example of this.\nNow, here\u2019s to hoping our awards systems, food festivals and collaborative chef events take note when they are able to resume normal operations.\nThis week, an e-mail from the head of a national restaurant awards system landed in my inbox explaining an evolution to its (what many have viewed as) out-of-date approach to determining the country\u2019s best eateries. Perhaps a baby step in the right direction, but a step nonetheless.\nThe death of the solo restaurateur and continued growth of hospitality groups\nEver-escalating operating costs will make it incredibly difficult for a new restaurateur to open a business in 2022. There is always strength in numbers, and in food service multiple locations or concepts can in some ways help with shared labour, buying power and just easier operations overall.\nRestaurant groups aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and are typically responsible for some of a city\u2019s most popular spots. Their pooled resources allow for a new eatery to open with plenty of buzz, seasoned staff and less risk.\nWith the prominence of hospitality groups across Alberta (Banff Hospitality Collective, Century Hospitality Group, Concorde Group), Saskatchewan (Taste Hospitality) and Manitoba (Academy Hospitality), it is more likely we will see talented young chefs being given their own restaurants to run under an existing umbrella, as opposed to venturing out on their own.\nThe reinvention of convenience stores and small grocers\nCalgary has been a bit ahead of the curve when it comes to funky convenience stores (Lukes Drug Mart, the Blue Store) and small-scale grocers (Bridgeland Market) \u2013 now it\u2019s time for the rest of the Prairies to catch up.\nIf what has happened in Calgary in the past few years \u2013 and, much more recently, Vancouver \u2013 is any indication, we will see a new generation of corner-store owners getting creative with humble neighbourhood shop spaces by stocking more locally minded products and including grab-and-go food stalls.\nYes, I still want the occasional slushy, but if I can pick up some craft sodas made by Dandy Brewing Co. and some cured meats by Empire Provisions too, all the better.\nCollaborations between restaurants and local creatives\nIt\u2019s becoming commonplace for businesses, including restaurants, to collaborate with visual artists, muralists and illustrators. The trend is fuelled in part by an earnest interest in supporting the local arts scene \u2013 but also by a desire to stand out in a crowded scene.\nIn Calgary, contemporary Mexican eatery Fonda Fora boasts striking portraits by Maya Gohill; the General Block building in Bridgeland (which houses Una Pizza, Village Ice Cream and Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters) regularly asks local muralists to create stunning artwork on its north-facing exterior.\nAnd while it\u2019s not an art collaboration per se, the new EQ3 flagship store in Winnipeg, the furniture maker\u2019s home base, uses its wares to bring to life a caf\u00e9 concept by celebrity chef Mandel Hitzer.\nWe have a weekly Western Canada newsletter written by our B.C. and Alberta bureau chiefs, providing a comprehensive package of the news you need to know about the region and its place in the issues facing Canada.

            "description": "Decision driven by popularity of healthy boxes, food bowl trend",
            "content": "Decision driven by popularity of healthy boxes, food bowl trend\nJars of Lucky Belly's garlic aioli and balsamic vinegarette are among the house-made salad dressings now being sold for people to take home.\n1 / 1 Jars of Lucky Belly's garlic aioli and balsamic vinegarette are among the house-made salad dressings now being sold for people to take home.\nIt\u2019s a new year and what better time to re-evaluate your diet and opt for lighter meals after all the heavy holiday foods? With the current ban on indoor dining, something that transitions successfully from restaurant to home is Lucky Belly's healthy boxes.\nThe healthy boxes are prepped daily with both freshly chopped vegetables and house pickled vegetables. There is a choice of a bed of rice, salad greens or quinoa and optional protein. The choices tick all the boxes: keto, gluten friendly, vegetarian, vegan or spicy. With several options to choose from, each has a distinctive, house made vinaigrette.\nA house favourite is the 'beet box' with shredded kale, pears, diced beets, feta cheese, shredded carrots, roasted honey peanuts, with arugula pesto vinaigrette. Add your choice of brown rice, greens or quinoa and optional protein.\nRecently, due to the popularity of their healthy boxes, the popular north end restaurant has offered the house dressings for take home purchase.\nChoose from balsamic vinaigrette, arugula pesto vinaigrette, avocado lime vinaigrette, lemon dill vinaigrette or garlic aioli. Available in a half-litre jar, it's perfect to dress a salad or add to an entree. Even the packaging, a mason jar, screams homemade. Use them for a salad or make your own rendition of a \u201cfood bowl.\" With five different dressings to choose from, the combinations are endless. My classic, homemade food bowl combines quinoa, baby greens, shaved carrots, pickled beets, pickled onions, goat\u2019s cheese, sunflower seeds, and grilled chicken breast. The balsamic vinaigrette would finish this off nicely.\nThe food bowl trend started a few years ago in North America and is gaining popularity as it can satisfy all special diet requirements plus provide a complete, nutritional meal in one entree.\nTypically grains, vegetables and protein are all arranged side by side with the dressing on the side. They are visually beautiful and as we eat with our eyes first, this is a healthy dish we can\u2019t get enough of.\nAlthough the healthy boxes are a customer favourite at Lucky Belly, they also have a full menu of delicious tacos, sandwiches, soups, sides, and desserts as well. Something of note is that all the dishes are all homemade, from scratch, not just the delicious dressings.\nWhen you make everything from scratch it adds to the prep time and labour costs, but the results speak for themselves. The seasoned chef/owner, Dino Roumeliotis, says this is the most labour-intensive menu he has ever had at one of his establishments. The result is what I call \u201cclean food.\"\nMany in Guelph\u2019s baseball community know Roumeliotis as a baseball personality, but some may not know him as a successful restaurateur.\nHe is a co-founder of the Greek Garden here in Guelph and managed the largest dinner theatre in the country before venturing back to his roots here in Guelph. He opened Lucky Belly with seasoned restaurateur John Melehes in 2016, but since 2020 he has taken over as sole-owner.\nThe concept for the licensed Guelph eatery is unlike the usual local, casual eateries. I call it fresh and healthy, with just enough kicked up, diner favourites for when you have the urge to indulge.\nRoumeliotis tells me that: \u201cvalue, quality and consistency are rule number one,\" and I think he has successfully achieved that here. That, and the great customer service provided from staff that have mostly been here since inception in 2016.\nWhen you have a leader that was raised by lifelong restaurateurs who said things like: \u201cDino, make people feel like they are in your home and they will come back\u2026,\u201d you can\u2019t help but have a winning combination.\nNow, I am eagerly awaiting the the reintroduction of their house-made, free, pickle bar with three varieties of pickles. Pickles are low calorie and healthy, right?",

Some of the country\u2019s largest supermarket chains this week reported that a growing number of suppliers are pushing to increase their prices. But it\u2019s still unclear just how much of the increases at the wholesale level will cascade down to customers, who are already contending with a near-record-setting jump in the consumer price index.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Lactalis Canada chief executive Mark Taylor said the 15 per cent increase represents the \u201cupper rate\u201d of the coming price increases, which will vary depending on how much milk goes into the product. The move to boost prices in the new year is partially in response to a forthcoming increase in the price that farmers get for their milk, he said in a statement Friday.\nCorporate News Scroll Left Scroll Right\nArticle content The Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), which establishes the \u201cfarm-gate\u201d price under the national supply management system, last month announced a historic 8.4 per cent increase on raw milk and 12.4 per cent for butter. The increase, which requires approval from the provinces, will help farmers cope with rising costs for livestock feed, fuel and equipment.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content It\u2019s the retailer who\u2019s left holding the bag of milk explaining to the customer why prices went up 15 per cent Gary Sands Mathieu Frigon, chief executive of the Dairy Processors Association of Canada, said inflation rates on dairy products have stayed substantially lower than overall food inflation over the past decade as dairy companies have worked to absorb rising input costs through efficiencies and narrowing margins. But all the cost increases can\u2019t be absorbed. Lactalis had to raise its rates \u201cas a result of these regulated increases and inflationary costs,\u201d Todd Johnston, vice-president of customer sales, said in a Nov. 4 letter obtained by the Financial Post. (Lactalis declined to comment on \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d communications with customers.) Gary Sands, senior vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers, said smaller retailers \u2014 which are also experiencing upticks in labour, energy and transport costs \u2014 won\u2019t be able to absorb all the increases.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u201cRetail will have to pass this cost on.

            "title": "\u2018No-recipe recipes\u2019 are the food trend we need right now",
            "description": "Cooking the no-recipe way is like playing music by ear, adding your own riffs as desired, says Sam Sifton of the New York Times Cooking, author of \u201cNo...",
            "content": "In 2011, the biggest thing in cookbooks (literally and figuratively) was Nathan Myhrvold\u2019s \u201cModernist Cuisine.\u201d The five-volume, 52-pound opus delved into the art and science of molecular gastronomy, with detailed instructions on how to suspend tomato water in spheres of basil oil and otherwise turn your condo kitchen into the chef\u2019s table at El Bulli.\nA decade later, however, El Bulli is shuttered and the appetite for the kind of deconstructed food they served has waned. With pandemic lockdowns forcing people to work with whatever is in our pantries, a newer, gentler approach to cooking has emerged. Welcome to the era of the no-recipe recipe.\n\u201cIf the pandemic has taught me anything, it\u2019s that a whole bunch more of us are cooking all of the time now,\u201d says Sam Sifton, founding editor of the New York Times Cooking and author of \u201cNo-Recipe Recipes,\u201d a new cookbook with an appropriately no-fuss title. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who previously would have gone out on a Friday night for an expensive dinner, who\u2019re staying home and having a roast chicken, a salad and a bottle of wine.\u201d\nAfter more than a year of cooking at home, Sifton says, home cooks are discovering the joys of creating simple meals, without worrying too much about quantities, special ingredients and other mainstays of traditional cookbooks.\nIn \u201cNo-Recipe Recipes,\u201d he offers a wide range of preparations, from peanut butter smoothies to chorizo nachos to soba noodles with tofu and kimchi, all of which promise big flavour and as little or as much complexity as you care to add. What you won\u2019t find are ingredient specifics measured to the millilitre, or the usual, precise step-by-step directives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recipe, just a different kind of recipe,\u201d says Sifton, who compares cooking the no-recipe way to playing music by ear, adding your own riffs and flourishes as desired. \u201cBasically you know it\u2019s going to go A to C to D and back to A, but how you get there, and what you do in between, is up to you.\u201d\nThe beauty of the no-recipe recipe, Sifton says, is that it has as much to offer beginners as seasoned home cooks. \u201cIf novice cooks get a great outcome from a no-recipe recipe, their confidence in the kitchen is going to soar,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the expert home cook can take the recipe in a direction that he or she wants with greater ease than following a traditional step-by-step recipe.\u201d\nSifton isn\u2019t the only one embracing this approach to cuisine. Pam Anderson\u2019s bestseller \u201cHow to Cook Without a Book\u201d \u2014 which was ahead of its time when it was first published, in 2000 \u2014 was completely updated and re-released in 2018.\nMore recently, Momofuku founder David Chang and food writer Priya Krishna teamed up to work on \u201cCooking at Home: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Recipes (And Love My Microwave),\u201d which is due out in October. Chang has also lent his support to Anyday, a dishware startup specializing in bowls with steam-trapping lids that you can use to make meals entirely in the microwave. The alluring premise is that cooking can be so fast, easy and improv-friendly, you can do it with whatever ingredient(s) you have on hand and a few pushes of a button.\n\u201cThese recipes are crucial right now,\u201d says Maggie Hoffman, digital director at cooking website Epicurious, whose No Recipe Needed series offers riffable versions of favourites like roast chicken thighs, baked pasta and Thai curry. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that are flexible enough that you can work them out on a busy weeknight, even if you haven\u2019t gotten groceries recently. You get the basic gist, and then you do your thing.\u201d\nNeither Sifton nor the experts at Epicurious insist that every recipe can or should be a no-recipe recipe; baking, for instance, doesn\u2019t usually lend itself to substitutions and omissions. For most things, however, no-recipe cooking is just a matter of taking what you\u2019ve got and making it the way you like it, adding inspiration and advice from the pros as needed.\nIt\u2019s far from a novel or revolutionary idea, but it\u2019s one with the potential to inspire and empower a whole new generation of enthusiastic home chefs. \u201cMy kids learn to cook by watching TikTok,\u201d Sifton says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing written down. They just watch a bunch of videos about making a Korean soft tofu stew, and then give it a shot.\u201d\nFour tips for success in the no-recipe kitchen\nStock your pantry. No-recipe recipes are only as good as what you put in them, and since weeknight dinner prep doesn\u2019t lend itself to last-minute groceries, your success will depend on keeping a supply of trusty staples. \u201cIt\u2019s really helpful to have hot sauces, vinegars and oils,\u201d says the New York Times Cooking\u2019s Sam Sifton. \u201cAnd in my case, plenty of peanut butter, chili garlic sauce, pickles and different starches.\u201d\nSubstitute as needed. The best thing about no-recipe cooking is its adaptability, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have Aleppo peppers or shallots; red pepper flakes and yellow onion will do just as well in most cases.\nEmbrace seasonality. Once you\u2019ve stocked up on the basics, you can get inspired by whatever looks freshest at the grocery store or farmer\u2019s market, and use that as a jumping-off point for your next no-recipe meal.\nUse a recipe (at least at first). \u201cFor some folks, going off-book can be intimidating,\u201d says Epicurious\u2019s Maggie Hoffman. \u201cSo one move is to make a recipe as written first, and see what it tastes like, and how you\u2019d like it to taste, [before you] personalize it the next time.\u201d\nSam Sifton\u2019s Roasted Mushrooms with Buttered Baguette\nSimplicity itself and beyond delicious, even if you aren\u2019t able to secure a pound of perfect chanterelles.\nBaguette\nButter\nWild mushrooms\nOlive oil\nThyme\nParsley\nBuy a baguette and some very good butter, along with a pound of wild mushrooms, preferably chanterelles.\nClean the mushrooms gently with a damp paper towel, then toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and some fresh thyme leaves, if you have them, or a scant scattering of dry if you don\u2019t. (If you don\u2019t have those either, no worries.)\nPut the mushrooms on a sheet pan and roast at 375\u00b0F for about 15 minutes, or until they\u2019ve released a fair amount of liquid. Remove the pan from the oven and drain off the liquid into a food storage container.\nContinue roasting the mushrooms for 25 to 30 minutes longer, or until they\u2019re a little crisp on the outside and soft inside and awesome.\nCut the baguette and slather with butter. Serve with the mushrooms, scattering some chopped parsley over the top of both, if you have some to spare.\nTip: You can use the mushroom liquid to add as a seasoning for soup. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer indefinitely.\nRecipe excerpted with permission from \u201cThe New York Times Cooking: No-Recipe Recipes.\u201d Text \u00a9 2021 by Sam Sifton and the New York Times Company.

During the pandemic, Canadian grocers said customers tended to shop less frequently but stock up more with each visit.\nLoblaw said it's expecting shoppers to return to its discount stores as restrictions ease, something it started to see in the three months ended June 19.\nThe company operates conventional grocery stores like Loblaws, Zehrs and Provigo as well as a discount division that includes No Frills and Maxi. Many consumers turned to full-service stores during the pandemic as part of a one-stop-shopping trend to reduce trips outside the home.\n\"Our grocery divisions performed well in the first part of the quarter, aided by COVID restrictions that kept Canadians eating at home during the spring and early summer,\" Loblaw chairman and president Galen G. Weston said during a conference call with analysts. He returned to the company as president in May following the retirement of Sarah Davis.\n\"As communities across the country began opening up, we were particularly pleased with the re-emergence of value-seeking shopping trips, which was good for our discount formats.\"\nMeanwhile, the company's drugstore division, which includes Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmaprix, recorded a virtually non-existent cough and cold season as public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 also reduced the spread of other viruses.\nBut the uptick in outdoor adventures as many indoor activities remained off limits provided a boost to the pharmacy's allergy medication sales.\nGiven the significant impact of the pandemic on the company's grocery and pharmacy divisions, Loblaw's outlook for the remainder of the year is difficult to predict.\n\"A great deal of uncertainty remains as the course of the pandemic, the reopening of the economy and the resulting impact on consumer behaviour remains dynamic,\" Loblaw chief financial officer Richard Dufresne told analysts. \"Sales trajectory remains difficult to forecast.\"\nImproving vaccination rates and easing restrictions \"will change our business yet again,\" Weston said.\n\"It is difficult to predict exactly what the magnitude of those impacts will be.\"\nLoblaw's second-quarter earnings beat analysts estimates, with adjusted profits for the quarter hitting $464 million or $1.35 per diluted share, up from $260 million or 72 cents per share in the second quarter of 2020.\nRevenues were $12.49 billion, compared with $11.96 billion in the prior year quarter as food same-store sales declined 0.1 per cent and Shoppers Drug Mart same-store sales increased 9.6 per cent.\nLoblaw was expected to post $1.21 per share in adjusted profits on $12.16 billion of revenues, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.\nThe company said its net income attributable to common shareholders was $375 million or $1.09 per diluted share, up 121.9 per cent from $169 million or 47 cents per share a year earlier.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 28, 2021.\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:L)\nBrett Bundale, The Canadian Press",

            "content": "Photo: Contributed\nI was researching odd food traditions for this week\u2019s column, and I came across a new trend in China called \u201cpunk health.\u201d I was so intrigued I stopped looking. You will have to wait for another week for me to offer a list, as I\u2019d like to expand on this concept, which I don\u2019t think is new or unique to China.\n\u201cPunk health\u201d is translated from a Chinese term, and it describes the behaviour of doing something excessive but then following it up with something overtly healthy. It has been popular with young people in urban China for a few years now, and there are products that cater to the trend.\nHave you had goji berries in your beer? Or coffee infused with medicinal herbs? Maybe you tried a healthy meal after a night out partying, or the reverse of working out like crazy and then indulging in fried chicken? These are all examples of punk health.\nI would argue this is a kind of youthful rebellion that has existed for generations. As a youth, you feel the invincibility from your shorter time on the planet, but you are still pressured by the counsel from elders about taking care of yourself. Punk health is the latest way of expressing that compromise.\nWhen I was young and working as a waitress at Earl\u2019s (we didn\u2019t call ourselves servers way back then), a popular food order with young people was potato skins and diet coke. Potato skins were served with a thick layer of melted cheese and a generous bowl of sour cream for dipping. I\u2019m not sure the diet coke was enough to offset that indulgence, but the choice did seem to make the diners feel better.\nThe contradiction of this kind of behaviour is the badge of honour that we wear when we are young. With every generation there is a struggle to create a new sort of identity, something different than our parents \u2013 we believe we have a better approach than they did. This comes amidst the pressure of wanting to be recognized as a success, ironically in a society where those giving recognition are often our elders.\nDeep down we can all feel like we need to make up for our lack of success in being our best selves at times. Combining junk food with healthy components might just be the latest innovation, like the new candies with melatonin that help insomniacs sleep.\nIn lesser extremes, there is an effort to balance that works well if we back up to the middle ground. A big cup of herbal tea after a night out will help re-hydrate you and your cookies n\u2019 cream protein shake after a workout does help your muscles recover.\nDo you remember exotic healthy remedies for excessive partying when you were young, or healthy obsessions that were meant to offset the marathon study binges? I certainly had a few. I suppose this is a stage we try out as we learn the balance of life, juggling our responsibilities and ambitions.\nIn China, young people are describing themselves either as \u201csalted fish\u201d \u2013 like a dead fish, with no ambitions \u2013 or \u201cbuddha youth,\u201d a disinterested generation that\u2019s unfazed by worldly obligations. They are disillusioned with seeing their parents who worked hard to earn money and in their elder years have health problems that money cannot solve.\nWe all need to find our own path. Young people have re-evaluated what they see as the most important goals in life for many generations. I look forward to seeing what the current youth come up with, and how they move past the punk phase.\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m going to enjoy my regular coffee with nothing in it to boost me; at my age, I\u2019m happy with my middle ground.",

            "description": "In this week's issue of our environment newsletter, we look at innovations in reusable takeout containers and why some food lovers are taking beef off their menus.",
            "content": "Hello, Earthlings! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)\nThis week:\nReusable takeout containers are a popular pandemic trend\nDriving schools get charged up about electric vehicles\nWhy beef is off the menu for some climate-conscious foodies\nReusable takeout containers are a popular pandemic trend\n(Reusables)\nWe've previously talked about the waste that takeout generates and some of the potential solutions . Since the pandemic started, a lack of indoor dining has made takeout the only restaurant option in many places, and as a result, both the problems \u2014 and the solutions \u2014 have multiplied.\nAt least five new startups across Canada are hoping to eliminate waste by allowing you to order your meal in reusable, returnable containers. A Friendlier Company (in Guelph, Ont.), Suppli (Toronto), Ekko (Waterloo, Ont.) and Reusables (Vancouver) are already serving restaurants and customers, while Re-Vita (Edmonton) is getting ready to launch.\nWhy now? The pandemic might not be an obvious time to launch new services for the struggling restaurant industry. But many people have started ordering more takeout and feel guilty about the waste, said Anastasia Kiku, co-founder of Reusables (whose wares are shown in the photo above). \"We just wanted to solve this problem,\" she said.\nAlso, in October, the federal government announced it would ban \"hard-to-recycle\" single-use plastic food takeout containers , such as black plastic and polystyrene. Kiku and the others say reusables are the best solution.\nJacqui Hutchings, co-founder and chief operating officer of A Friendlier Company, said the pandemic has also forced people to get used to change. \"Now is the time to implement a new system,\" she said. \"Just offer it as an option and see what happens.\"\nWhat kind of container: In most cases, the food comes in stainless steel containers. Crystal Kruis, who co-founded Ekko with her daughter Chloe, said metal is more durable and is what customers said they wanted.\nThe exception is A Friendlier Company, which uses polypropylene plastic containers. The company says the containers are light, stackable and their low cost reduces fees (it's the only service that's free for customers).\nHow it works: Suppli, Reusables and A Friendlier Company give customers the option to order through popular food delivery apps, although you generally have to sign up through their own website or app first, and leave a note about the use of reusable containers in the delivery instructions.\nSuppli and Ekko have per-order fees ranging from 50 cents to $2, while Reusables charges a $5 monthly fee. A Friendlier Company doesn't charge customers for the service, although diners do have to pay a refundable deposit of 50 cents to $1 per container.\nRestaurants pay the companies a fee that includes the container rental, cleaning and restocking. Generally, the fee is designed to be comparable to what the restaurants are already paying for disposable containers.\nThe companies track their containers using QR codes or electronic ID tags to make sure they're returned to a participating restaurant or drop-off point within one to two weeks. Otherwise, customers get charged.\nHow it's going: So far, each company has between four and 30 participating restaurants.\nCrystal Kruis at Ekko said in the first two days after her company launched in April, the company replaced 231 takeout containers with reusables \u2014 roughly enough to stack up to the height of a four-storey building.\nShe said some customers told her they had been avoiding takeout because of the waste. Having a reusable option allowed them to resume supporting local restaurants.\nHutchings at A Friendlier Company, which launched in October, said some participating restaurants have switched completely to reusables and stopped offering customers disposable options at all.\n\u2014 Emily Chung\nReader feedback\n\"Thanks for the story on banning short-haul flights ,\" writes K Braun. \"Europe has such a good train network; the rise of companies like EasyJet and RyanAir that made it so cheap to fly those short hops across the continent supported a terrible trend to fly instead of taking the train. I hope more jurisdictions in Europe punish short-haul flights and incentivize train travel.\n\"And I'd love to see this come to Canada. Why are people flying between Montreal/Toronto/Ottawa? Take the train! Why isn't there a better train link between Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo? Why is there no high-speed train between Calgary and Edmonton? Canada was united by the train but it has been neglected in favour of the wasteful highway. I'd love to see train travel \u2014 as a genuine option for not only travel but also commuting \u2014 become a genuine option in Canada.\"\nWrite us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.\nOld issues of What on Earth? are right here .\nThere's also a radio show and podcast!

With that in mind, a number of jurisdictions in Canada have opened up all-electric driving schools . As with most things to do with electric vehicles (EVs), Quebec is arguably furthest in front. The province's Transportation Ministry chipped in $4.5 million toward a two-year pilot project called E-roule. Launched in 2020, it has so far facilitated funding for 30 driving schools to teach students in EVs. While E-roule estimates that its efforts have already saved 102 tonnes of CO2 emissions, its larger impact will likely be in helping produce a generation of drivers who may never handle a gas-powered vehicle.\n(Guillaume Lavallee/AFP via Getty Images)\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\nThe World Steel Association says the industry is responsible for up to nine per cent of worldwide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Historically, metallurgical coal has been key in the manufacture of steel. But Swedish steel maker SSAB is looking to clean hydrogen as a way to make \"fossil-fuel-free steel.\"\nSpeaking of the Swedes, furniture giant Ikea has undertaken a number of steps over the years to reduce its environmental footprint. The company has talked about striving for a more circular mode of consumption, where its items are recycled or reused rather than simply discarded. To that end, Ikea stores in the U.K. will start a program that has been tested in Portugal and Australia, where they buy back unwanted furniture items .\nWhy beef is off the menu for some climate-conscious foodies\n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nGrowing up on a farm in southern Ontario, Toronto chef Ikeila Wright says she ate enough beef to last her a lifetime.\nBack then, her parents grew crops and raised livestock. Now, she's the chef and owner at One Love Vegetarian, a Jamaican restaurant in Toronto that serves hearty dishes such as callaloo, a barbecue tofu stir fry, potato and chickpea rotis and a signature corn soup.\n\"What I eat, what I put on my plate, is personal. And I think for everyone it should be personal, but it also should be conscious,\" Wright said. \"We have to think about future generations, because history will find us accountable for the choices that we make now.\"\nWright, who chose to become vegetarian for health and environmental reasons, is part of a growing number of people worried about the carbon footprint of meat \u2014 and beef in particular, which the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates is responsible for 41 per cent of all livestock emissions.\nLast week, the U.S. food magazine and website Epicurious announced it was no longer publishing beef recipes because of how carbon-intensive the protein is.\nIn an explanatory post , the magazine's editors cited statistics from the World Resources Institute that beef requires 20 times more land and makes 20 times more greenhouse gases than common plant proteins, such as beans. It is also three times more carbon-intensive than poultry and pork.\nDavid Tamarkin, one of the co-authors of the post, told CBC Radio's As It Happens the \"whole point\" of a food publication like Epicurious \"is to influence the way that people eat,\" he said.\nGiven it receives millions of users every month, \"if we were successful in replacing one beef meal with one vegetarian meal a month, that is a huge win. Because if everybody did that, that would make an enormous impact on the sustainability of our diets.\"\nSo how much beef do people need to cut down on to make an impact on greenhouse gas emissions?\nResearcher Jim Dyer set out to answer this question in a report last year for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The study, aimed at the livestock industry, modelled scenarios where Canadians tweaked their meat consumption without reducing their overall protein intake or going fully vegetarian.\nThe modelling found that if red meat consumption dropped 25 per cent \u2014 in line with medical recommendations \u2014 and was one-quarter beef and three-quarters pork, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector dropped 10.7 per cent. (The study assumed that any drop in red-meat consumption was replaced with chicken.)\nOther analyses, including the planetary health diet published in The Lancet in 2019 , recommend cutting meat consumption down to just one serving of beef per week.\nDyer's paper did not model the impact of cutting out meat entirely from the Canadian diet and replacing it with plant-based proteins like pulses. But he said shifting to a vegan diet has an even greater impact on emissions.\n\"The first message was really quite simple, and that is: eat less beef,\" he said.\nTypically, grass-fed beef \u2014 where cattle graze in a pasture \u2014 has been analyzed as higher in emissions than feedlot beef, in part because of land use. But many studies, including Dyer's, don't account for the other environmental benefits of grass-fed beef, such as the carbon sequestration in the grass and soil.\nThat can mean the higher emissions from grass-fed beef are offset by the carbon sequestered in the pasture, according to a 2018 study , although uncertainty remains about how much carbon is sequestered.\nThat's important for Cedric MacLeod, a grass-fed beef producer in New Brunswick. MacLeod and his family operate Local Valley Farm, where cattle roam free and feed on 40 hectares of strategically planted grass. The farm uses as little fertilizer as possible by planting specific types of grasses and using manure \"very effectively,\" and runs on solar energy.\nMacLeod, a soil scientist by training, said principles of sustainability are top of mind. \"We do everything we can, certainly, to minimize our emissions.\"\nMacLeod said that people should be concerned about where and how their food is raised, and be willing to pay for it.\n\"The chicken growers play a role. The potato growers play a role. The corn and soybean guys play a role. The cattle sector plays an important role, because we're managing the grassland,\" MacLeod said.\n\"We're all contributing to the sector's contribution to the fight against climate change.\"\n\u2014 Inayat Singh and Alice Hopton\nStay in touch!\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

Photo by Errol McGihon / Postmedia\nArticle content In May last year, after the novel coronavirus began reshaping how Ottawa\u2019s restaurants would operate, Nara Sok was convinced that running commercial kitchens with no dining rooms attached to them was the new way to go. This spring, his fledgling business Casper Kitchen has given him lots of reasons to think he was right: more than 210,000, if you assign a reason to every dollar of revenue the York Street enterprise has earned over the last three months. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Latest pandemic restaurant trend brings multiple food brands under one roof Back to video \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2026 We\u2019ve been surprising ourselves,\u201d Sok says, sharing an impressive report on his food sales via the third-party delivery service Uber Eats. His business partner, David Wen, adds more concretely: \u201cEvery quarter we\u2019re doubling our business. If we continue this trajectory, within our first year, we might become a million-dollar company.\u201d That\u2019s not be bad at all for a business selling to-go Vietnamese food, Korean fried chicken and Southern barbecue fare. For that matter, many an Ottawa restaurant whose sales have withered during the COVID-19 era might be envious.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Of course, Wen\u2019s proposition is a big one given the incessant uncertainties businesses face during the pandemic. But currently, with locked-down food lovers waiting for dining rooms and patios to open, never mind vaccinations, the optimism at Casper Kitchen is hard to counter. It\u2019s also shared by other Ottawa businesses that host multiple food brands under their roofs. While business models may differ somewhat, these new kitchens and eateries are seizing a moment that has been gruelling for other restaurants, but is seemingly in their favour. Casper Kitchen\u2019s name riffs on \u201cghost kitchen,\u201d the industry term for a stand-alone kitchen focused on takeout and delivery rather than dine-in business. Casper\u2019s Viet Fresh brand took its first order in early December. Since then, the brands Banh Mi Bros, which makes Vietnamese sandwiches, Old\u2019s BBQ and Fried Chicken for the Seoul have opened. Wen and Sok say Casper Kitchen owes its success to savvy digital marketing, premium ingredients and packaging and a tireless focus on customer satisfaction. The future could see more brands added to the Casper Kitchen roster, plus an in-house delivery service and an app, they add. \u201cIt\u2019s undecided if we will ever have our own dine-in (service). We don\u2019t need it right now,\u201d says Sok, who also owns Tomo, the pan-Asian restaurant and lounge on Clarence Street. Wen, whose background is in technology, thinks of Casper Kitchen as more than a money-maker gratifying hungry customers. He calls it an incubator, developing brands that could proliferate elsewhere downtown, be spun off as dine-in restaurants in Ottawa\u2019s suburbs or even be sold to a franchising company wanting to take a brand nation-wide.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \u201cEvery brand has its own identity and growth trajectory,\u201d Wen says. \u201cWe have unlimited potential. We\u2019re only limited by our creativity.\u201d In recent months, the Mad Radish restaurant chain has expanded its offerings, following a rationale similar to that of Casper Kitchen. The flagship Mad Radish in downtown Ottawa focused on salads when it opened in July 2017. But a push began last summer to sell Mexican food under the Luisa\u2019s Burritos & Bowls brand and thin-crust pizzas under the Revival Pizza brand from Mad Radish locations. \u201cThe pandemic forced us to think much more critically about our business,\u201d Mad Radish founder David Segal says. \u201cIt made a lot of sense to extend into new product categories. \u201cWe\u2019re combining the best elements of a ghost kitchen with the best elements of a restaurant,\u201d Segal continues. \u201cThe food\u2019s got to be made to order, it\u2019s got to be fresh, but it\u2019s got to be built to travel.\u201d Mad Radish\u2019s Albert Street location, once the chain\u2019s top performer, suffered as Ottawa\u2019s pandemic-stricken downtown emptied, Segal says. But the multi-brand Barrhaven store, which opened in March, is doing well despite the current lockdown. In Barrhaven, customers can select from all three brands in one order, sharing a Revival pizza and a Mad Radish salad, with a Luisa\u2019s burrito on the side, Segal says. \u201cThey like the variety.\u201d In keeping with Segal\u2019s suburban strategy, a multi-brand Mad Radish is to open in Kanata next year, and an Orl\u00e9ans store is envisioned. They will still have 20 to 30 seats \u2014 \u201cBut you don\u2019t need 40 to 50,\u201d Segal says \u2014 for dine-in customers. \u201cWe believe future of restaurants is multi-channel,\u201d Segal says.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content This month\u2019s opening of Chop Shop in Hintonburg sees an Ottawa-centred example of the thinking that made Mad Radish diversify. Launched in the space that was the recently shuttered Bar Laurel, Chop Shop will offer the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d from the downtown eateries El Camino, Shelby Burger and the yet-to-open pizzeria Giulia, general manager Jana Renaud says. Photo by Julie Oliver / Postmedia The restaurants under Chop Shop\u2019s banner are commonly owned, and the owners saw an opportunity to expand into a new neighbourhood when Bar Laurel closed, Renaud says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept for us to be cooking burgers and tacos at the same time, and eventually pizza,\u201d she says. The kitchen Chop Shop inherited had to be reconfigured to suit the new business\u2019s needs, she adds. Currently serving tacos only, Chop Shop will welcome dine-in customers when pandemic restrictions relax. Once it\u2019s fully operational, it be a sort of \u201cmicro food hall,\u201d Renaud says. In the City Centre building, the ghost kitchen called the Kitchen was a pandemic pivot by the company Lunch, partner Jordan Lazarovitz says. After more than a decade of selling grab-and-go lunches from its stores and vending machines, Lunch was \u201cleft with zero business\u201d after downtown was deserted, Lazarovitz says. Lunch\u2019s City Centre commissary pivoted last fall to become a ghost kitchen, renting space to food businesses. The Kitchen rents by the week and tenants have come and gone. These days, the 3,000-square-foot space\u2019s tenants include Chef Jae-Anthony Popup, which serves Caribbean food, Peruvian kitchen Raphael Express and Filipino food business Lola\u2019s Kitchen. Lazarovitz also has Side Piece and Wing Ding, his own chicken-based brands. Given the blow the pandemic dealt Lunch, it makes sense that Lazarovitz does not brim with the optimism that buoys Casper Kitchen and Mad Radish. \u201cYes, more people order in now. But for how long? We\u2019ll see if it has legs or not,\u201d Lazarovitz says of his ghost kitchen. phum@postmedia.ocm\nShare this article in your social network\nLatest National Stories Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nOttawa Citizen Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from Ottawa Citizen, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
